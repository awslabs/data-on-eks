# WARNING: This VPC module includes the creation of an Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway, which simplifies cluster deployment and testing, primarily intended for sandbox accounts.
# IMPORTANT: For preprod and prod use cases, it is crucial to consult with your security team and AWS architects to design a private infrastructure solution that aligns with your security requirements
