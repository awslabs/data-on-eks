# Ray Serve can automatically scale deployment replicas up to 3 based on incoming traffic.
# Each replica in this example requires one GPU. For GPU types g5.xlarge to g5.16xlarge, a single node with one GPU can only run one replica.
# However, g5.12xlarge comes with 4 GPUs, allowing you to run all 4 replicas on a single node.
