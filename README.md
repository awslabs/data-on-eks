## 🏆 Motivation
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a widely adopted system for orchestrating containerized software at scale. As more users migrate their data and machine learning workloads to Kubernetes, they often face the complexity of managing the Kubernetes ecosystem and selecting the right tools and configurations for their specific needs.

At [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), we understand the challenges users encounter when deploying and scaling data workloads on Kubernetes. To simplify the process and enable users to quickly conduct proof-of-concepts and build production-ready clusters, we have developed Data on EKS (DoEKS). DoEKS offers opinionated open-source blueprints that provide end-to-end logging and observability, making it easier for users to deploy and manage Spark on EKS, Kubeflow, MLFlow, Airflow, Presto, Kafka, Cassandra, and other data workloads. With DoEKS, users can confidently leverage the power of Kubernetes for their data and machine learning needs without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.

## 🤝 Support & Feedback
DoEKS is maintained by AWS Solution Architects and is not an AWS service. Support is provided on a best effort basis by the Data on EKS Blueprints community. If you have feedback, feature ideas, or wish to report bugs, please use the [Issues](https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks/issues) section of this GitHub.
