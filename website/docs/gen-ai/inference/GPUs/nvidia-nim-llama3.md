:::warning
Deployment of ML models on EKS requires access to GPUs or Neuron instances. If your deployment isn't working, it’s often due to missing access to these resources. Also, some deployment patterns rely on Karpenter autoscaling and static node groups; if nodes aren't initializing, check the logs for Karpenter or Node groups to resolve the issue.

# NVIDIA NIM LLM Deployment on Amazon EKS

## What is NVIDIA NIM?

NVIDIA NIM makes it easy for IT and DevOps teams to self-host large language models (LLMs) in their own managed environments while still providing developers with industry standard APIs that allow them to build powerful copilots, chatbots, and AI assistants that can transform their business. Leveraging NVIDIA’s cutting-edge GPU acceleration and scalable deployment, NIM offers the fastest path to inference with unparalleled performance.

## Why NIM?

NIM abstracts away model inference internals such as execution engine and runtime operations. They are also the most performant option available whether it be with TRT-LLM, vLLM or others.

NIMs are packaged as container images on a per model/model family basis. Each NIM container is with a model, such as `meta/llama3-8b-instruct`. These containers include a runtime that runs on any NVIDIA GPU with sufficient GPU memory, but some model/GPU combinations are optimized. NIM automatically downloads the model from NVIDIA NGC Catalog, leveraging a local filesystem cache if available.

## Overview of this deployment pattern on Amazon EKS

This pattern combines the capabilities of NVIDIA NIM, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and various AWS services to deliver a high-performance and cost-optimized model serving infrastructure.

1. NVIDIA NIM Container Images: NVIDIA NIM provides a streamlined approach to hosting LLM models like Llama3 within containerized environments. This allows customers to leverage their private models while ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure. We will bring detailed setup steps to NIM deployments.

2. Karpenter for Instance-Level Scaling: Karpenter, an open-source node provisioning project, enables rapid and efficient scaling of Amazon EKS clusters at the instance level. This ensures that the model serving infrastructure can adapt to dynamic workload demands, optimizing resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.

3. Spot instances: Considering LLMs are stateless, customers can leverage spot instances to significantly reduce costs.

4. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS): Amazon EFS provides scalable, elastic file storage for use with Amazon EKS. It allows multiple pods to access the same file system concurrently, making it ideal for storing and sharing model artifacts, datasets, and other persistent data across the cluster. EFS automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files, eliminating the need for capacity planning and management.

5. Terraform with EKS Blueprints: To streamline the deployment and management of this solution, we leverage Terraform and EKS Blueprints. This infrastructure-as-code approach enables automated provisioning of the entire stack, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and efficient resource management.

By combining these components, our proposed solution delivers a powerful and cost-effective model serving infrastructure tailored for large language models. With NVIDIA NIM's seamless integration, Amazon EKS's scalability with Karpenter, customers can achieve high performance while minimizing infrastructure costs.

echo "$NGC_API_KEY" | docker login nvcr.io --username '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
```

3. Test pulling an image from NGC:
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama3-8b-instruct:latest
```
You do not have to wait for it to complete, just to make sure the API key is valid to pull the image.
</details>

The following are required to run this tutorial
- An active AWS account with admin equivalent permissions
- [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Deploy

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks.git
```

**1. Configure the NGC API Key**

Retrieve your NGC API key from [NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment-guide-spark-rapids-accelerator/0.1.0/appendix-ngc.html) and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export TF_VAR_ngc_api_key=<replace-with-your-NGC-API-KEY>
```

**2. Installation**

Important Note: Ensure that you update the region in the variables.tf file before deploying the blueprint. Additionally, confirm that your local region setting matches the specified region to prevent any discrepancies. For example, set your `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<REGION>"` to the desired region:

Run the installation script:

:::info


This pattern deploys a model called `nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama3-8b-instruct`. You can modify the `nim_models` variable in the `variables.tf` file to add more models. Multiple models can be deployed simultaneously using this pattern.
:::

:::caution

Ensure you have specified enough GPUs for each model before enabling additional models through these variables. Also, verify that your AWS account has access to sufficient GPUs.
This pattern uses Karpenter to scale GPU nodes, restricted to G5 instances by default. You can modify the Karpenter node pool to include other instances like p4 and p5 if needed.

:::


```bash
cd data-on-eks/ai-ml/nvidia-triton-server
export TF_VAR_enable_nvidia_nim=true
export TF_VAR_enable_nvidia_triton_server=false
./install.sh
```

This process will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.

**3. Verify the Installation**

Once the installation finishes, you may find the configure_kubectl command from the output. Run the following to configure EKS cluster access

```bash
# Creates k8s config file to authenticate with EKS
aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name nvidia-triton-server
```

Check the status of your pods deployed

```bash
kubectl get all -n nim
```

You should see output similar to the following:
<details>
<summary>Click to expand the deployment details</summary>

```text

```
</details>

The `llama3-8b-instruct` model is deployed with a StatefulSet in `nim` namespace. As it is running, Karpenter provisioned a GPU
Check the Karpenter provisioned node.

```bash
kubectl get node -l type=karpenter -L node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
```

```text
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION               INSTANCE-TYPE
ip-100-64-77-39.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   4m46s   v1.30.0-eks-036c24b   g5.2xlarge
```

**4. Verify the deployed model**

Once all pods in `nim` namespace is ready with `1/1` status, use below command to verify it's ready to serve the traffic. To verify, expose the model serving service with port-forward using kubectl.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n nim service/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct 8000
```

Then you can invoke the deployed model with a simple HTTP request with curl command.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "http://localhost:8000/v1/completions" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "model": "meta/llama3-8b-instruct",
      "prompt": "Once upon a time",
      "max_tokens": 64
      }'
```

you will see similar output like the following

```json

### Testing the Llama3 model deployed with NIM
It's time to test the Llama3 just deployed. First setup a simple environment for the testing.

```bash
cd data-on-eks/gen-ai/inference/nvidia-nim/nim-client
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install openai
```

We have prepared some prompts in prompts.txt , it contains 20 prompts. You can run following commands with the prompts to verify the generated outputs.

```bash
python3 client.py --input-prompts prompts.txt --results-file results.txt
```

You will see an output something like below:

The key differences between traditional machine learning models and very large language models (vLLM) are:

1. **Scale**: vLLMs are massive, with billions of parameters, whereas traditional models typically have millions.
2. **Training data**: vLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, often sourced from the internet, whereas traditional models are trained on smaller, curated datasets.
3. **Architecture**: vLLMs often use transformer architectures, which are designed for sequential data like text, whereas traditional models may use feedforward networks or recurrent neural networks.
4. **Training objectives**: vLLMs are often trained using masked language modeling or next sentence prediction tasks, whereas traditional models may use classification, regression, or clustering objectives.
5. **Evaluation metrics**: vLLMs are typically evaluated using metrics like perplexity, accuracy, or fluency, whereas traditional models may use metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
6. **Interpretability**: vLLMs are often less interpretable due to their massive size and complex architecture, whereas traditional models may be more interpretable due to their smaller size and simpler architecture.

These differences enable vLLMs to excel in tasks like language translation, text generation, and conversational AI, whereas traditional models are better suited for tasks like image classification or regression.

=========

TensorRT (Triton Runtime) optimizes LLM (Large Language Model) inference on NVIDIA hardware by:

1. **Model Pruning**: Removing unnecessary weights and connections to reduce model size and computational requirements.
2. **Quantization**: Converting floating-point models to lower-precision integer formats (e.g., INT8) to reduce memory bandwidth and improve performance.
3. **Kernel Fusion**: Combining multiple kernel launches into a single launch to reduce overhead and improve parallelism.
4. **Optimized Tensor Cores**: Utilizing NVIDIA's Tensor Cores for matrix multiplication, which provides significant performance boosts.
5. **Batching**: Processing multiple input batches concurrently to improve throughput.
6. **Mixed Precision**: Using a combination of floating-point and integer precision to balance accuracy and performance.
7. **Graph Optimization**: Reordering and reorganizing the computation graph to minimize memory access and optimize data transfer.

By applying these optimizations, TensorRT can significantly accelerate LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware, achieving faster inference times and improved performance.

## Performance Testing with NVIDIA GenAI-Perf Tool

[GenAI-Perf](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/client/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer/genai-perf/README.html) is a command line tool for measuring the throughput and latency of generative AI models as served through an inference server.

GenAI-Perf can be used as standard tool to benchmark with other models deployed with inference server. But this tool requires a GPU. To make it easier, we provide you a pre-configured manifest `genaiperf-deploy.yaml` to run the tool.

```bash
cd data-on-eks/gen-ai/inference/nvidia-nim
kubectl apply -f genaiperf-deploy.yaml
```

Once the pod is ready with running status `1/1`, can execute into the pod.

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get po -l app=tritonserver -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash
```

Run the testing to the deployed NIM Llama3 model

```bash
genai-perf \
  -m meta/llama3-8b-instruct \
  --service-kind openai \
  --endpoint v1/completions \
  --endpoint-type completions \
  --num-prompts 100 \

## Observability

As part of this blueprint, we have also deployed the Kube Prometheus stack, which provides Prometheus server and Grafana deployments for monitoring and observability.

First, let's verify the services deployed by the Kube Prometheus stack:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text

```

The NVIDIA NIM LLM service expose metrics via `/metrics` endpoint from `nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct` service at port `8000`. Verify it by running

```bash
kubectl get svc -n nim
kubectl port-forward -n nim svc/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct 8000

curl localhost:8000/metrics # run this in another terminal
```

### Grafana Dashboard

We provides a pre-configured Grafana dashboard to better visualize NIM status. In the Grafana dashboard below, it contains several important metrics:

- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: The latency between the initial inference request to the model and the return of the first token.
- **Inter-Token Latency (ITL)**: The latency between each token after the first.
- **Total Throughput**: The total number of tokens generated per second by the NIM.

You can find more metrics description from this [document](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/observability.html).

![NVIDIA LLM Server](../img/nim-dashboard.png)

You can monitor metrics such as Time-to-First-Token, Inter-Token-Latency, KV Cache Utilization metrics.
