# EMR on EKS Observability

## [Monitoring Amazon EMR on EKS with Amazon Managed Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/monitoring-amazon-emr-on-eks-with-amazon-managed-prometheus-and-amazon-managed-grafana/)

In this post, we will learn to build end-to-end observability for EMR on EKS Spark workloads by leveraging Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus to collect and store the metrics generated by Spark Applications. We will then use Amazon Managed Grafana to build dashboards for monitoring use cases
