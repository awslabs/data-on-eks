Fannie Mae’s Single-Family Loan Performance Data has a comprehensive dataset starting from 2013. It provides valuable insights into the credit performance of a portion of Fannie Mae’s single-family book of business. This dataset is designed to assist investors in better understanding the credit performance of single-family loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae.

#### Step 1: Building a Custom Docker Image

- To pull the Spark Rapids base image from the EMR on EKS ECR repository located in `us-west-2`, log in:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 895885662937.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

If you're located in a different region, please refer to: this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/docker-custom-images-tag.html.).

- To build your Docker image locally, use the following command:

Build the custom Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`. Choose a tag for the image, such as 0.10.

:::info
Please note that the build process may take some time, depending on your network speed. Keep in mind that the resulting image size will be approximately `23.5GB`.
:::


```bash
cd ~/data-on-eks/ai-ml/emr-spark-rapids/examples/xgboost
docker build -t emr-6.10.0-spark-rapids-custom:0.10 -f Dockerfile .
```

- Replace `<ACCOUNTID>` with your AWS account ID. Log in to your ECR repository with the following command:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ACCOUNTID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

    2023-06-22 19:20:08  180159771 2022Q4.csv
```

### Step3: Run the EMR Spark XGBoost Job

Here, we will utilize a helper shell script to execute the job. This script requires user input.

This script will ask for certain inputs that you can obtain from Terraform outputs. See the example below.

```bash
cd ai-ml/emr-spark-rapids/examples/xgboost/ && chmod +x execute_spark_rapids_xgboost.sh
./execute_spark_rapids_xgboost.sh

# Example inputs shown below
    Did you copy the fannie-mae-single-family-loan-performance data to S3 bucket(y/n): y
    Enter the customized Docker image URI: public.ecr.aws/o7d8v7g9/emr-6.10.0-spark-rapids:0.11
    Enter EMR Virtual Cluster AWS Region: us-west-2
    Enter the EMR Virtual Cluster ID: 949wt7zuphox1beiv0i30v65i
    Enter the EMR Execution Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNTID>:role/emr-spark-rapids-emr-eks-data-team-a
    Enter the CloudWatch Log Group name: /emr-on-eks-logs/emr-spark-rapids/emr-ml-team-a
    Enter the S3 Bucket for storing PySpark Scripts, Pod Templates, Input data and Output data.<bucket-name>: emr-spark-rapids-<ACCOUNTID>-us-west-2
    Enter the number of executor instances (4 to 8): 8
```

Verify the pod status

![Alt text](img/spark-rapids-pod-status.png)


:::info
Note that the first execution might take longer as it needs to download the image for the EMR Job Pod, Driver, and Executor pods. Each pod may take up to 8 minutes to download the Docker image. Subsequent runs should be faster (usually under 30 seconds), thanks to image caching
:::

### Step4: Verify the Job results

- Log in to check the Spark driver pod logs from either CloudWatch logs or your S3 bucket.

Here's a sample output from the log file:

### ML Pipeline for Fannie Mae Single Loan Performance Dataset

**Step1**: Preprocess and clean the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and other data inconsistencies.This may involve techniques like data imputation,one-hot encoding, and data normalization.

**Step2**: Create additional features from the existing ones that might provide more useful information for predicting loan performance. For example, you could extract features like loan-to-value ratio, borrower's credit score range, or loan origination year.

**Step3**: Divide the dataset into two parts: one for training the XGBoost model and one for evaluating its performance. This allows you to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

**Step4**: Feed the training dataset into XGBoost to train the model. XGBoost will analyze the loan attributes and their corresponding loan performance labels to learn the patterns and relationships between them. The objective is to predict whether a loan is likely to default or perform well based on the given features.

**Step5**: Once the model is trained, use the evaluation dataset to assess its performance. This involves analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to measure how well the model predicts loan performance

**Step6**: If the performance is not satisfactory, you can tune the XGBoost hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, tree depth, or regularization parameters, to improve the model's accuracy or address issues like overfitting.

**Step7**: Finally, with a trained and validated XGBoost model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen loan data. These predictions can help in identifying potential risks associated with loan default or evaluating loan performance.

###  GPU Monitoring with DCGM Exporter, Prometheus and Grafana

Observability plays a crucial role in managing and optimizing hardware resources such as GPUs, particularly in machine learning workloads where the GPU utilization is high. The ability to monitor GPU usage in real-time, identify trends, and detect anomalies can significantly impact performance tuning, troubleshooting, and efficient resource utilization.

[NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) plays a key role in GPU observability. It automates the deployment of the necessary components to run GPU workloads on Kubernetes. One of its components, the [DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) Exporter](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-telemetry/latest/index.html), is an open-source project that exports GPU metrics in a format that can be ingested by Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution. These metrics include GPU temperature, memory usage, GPU utilization, and more. The DCGM Exporter allows you to monitor these metrics on a per-GPU basis, providing granular visibility into your GPU resources.

The NVIDIA GPU Operator, in combination with the DCGM Exporter, exports GPU metrics to a Prometheus server. With its flexible query language, Prometheus allows you to slice and dice data to generate insights into resource usage patterns.

However, Prometheus is not designed for long-term data storage. This is where the [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) comes into play. It provides a fully-managed, secure, and scalable service for Prometheus that makes it easy to analyze operational data at scale without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

Visualizing these metrics and creating informative dashboards is where Grafana excels. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, offering rich visualizations to represent collected metrics intuitively. When combined with Prometheus, Grafana can display the GPU metrics collected by the DCGM Exporter in a user-friendly manner.

The NVIDIA GPU Operator is configured to export metrics to the Prometheus server, which then remote-writes these metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). As a user, you can log into the Grafana WebUI, deployed as part of the blueprint, and add AMP as a data source. Following this, you can import the open-source [GPU monitoring dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12239-nvidia-dcgm-exporter-dashboard/) that presents GPU metrics in an easily digestible format, facilitating real-time performance monitoring and resource optimization.

1. **NVIDIA GPU Operator**: Installed on your Kubernetes cluster, the NVIDIA GPU Operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of GPU resources. It deploys NVIDIA drivers and the DCGM Exporter on each GPU-equipped node.
2. **DCGM Exporter**: The DCGM Exporter runs on each node, collecting GPU metrics and exposing them to Prometheus.
3. **Prometheus**: Prometheus is a time-series database that collects metrics from various sources, including the DCGM Exporter. It pulls metrics from the exporter at regular intervals and stores them. In this setup, you would configure Prometheus to remote-write the collected metrics to AMP.
4. **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)**: AMP is a fully-managed Prometheus service provided by AWS. It takes care of long-term storage, scalability, and security of your Prometheus data.
5. **Grafana**: Grafana is a visualization tool that can query AMP for the collected metrics, and display them on informative dashboards.

In this blueprint, we leverage DCGM to write GPU metrics to both Prometheus and Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). To verify the GPU metrics, you can use Grafana by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n grafana
``

Login to Grafana using `admin` as the username, and retrieve the password from Secrets Manager using the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id emr-spark-rapids-grafana --region us-west-2
```

Once logged in, add the AMP datasource to Grafana and import the Open Source GPU monitoring dashboard. You can then explore the metrics and visualize them using the Grafana dashboard, as shown in the screenshot below.
