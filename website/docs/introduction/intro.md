# Introduction
Data on Amazon EKS(DoEKS) - A tool for building [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) managed and self-managed scalable data platforms on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). With DoEKS, You have access to:

1. Robust Deployment Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), among other
2. Best Practices for Deploying Data Solutions on Amazon EKS
3. Detailed Performance Benchmark Reports
4. Hands-on Samples of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)/[ML](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/) Jobs and various other frameworks
5. In-depth Reference Architectures and Data Blogs to keep you ahead of the curve

# Architecture
