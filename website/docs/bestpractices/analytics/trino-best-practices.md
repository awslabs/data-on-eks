# Trino on EKS Best Practices
[Trino](https://trino.io/) deployment on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS) delivers distributed query processing with cloud-native scalability. Organizations can optimize costs by selecting specific compute instances and storage solutions that match their workload requirements while they  combine the power of Trino with the scalability and flexibility of EKS using [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).

This guide provides prescriptive guidance for deploying Trino on EKS. It focuses on achieving high scalability and low cost through optimal configurations, effective resource management, and cost-saving strategies. We cover detailed configurations for popular file formats such as Hive and Iceberg. These configurations ensure seamless data access and optimize performance. Our goal is to help you set up a Trino deployment that is both efficient and cost-effective.

We have a [deployment-ready blueprint](https://awslabs.github.io/data-on-eks/docs/blueprints/distributed-databases/trino) for deploying Trino on EKS, which incorporates the best practices discussed here.

### Provisioning
You can provision and scale underlying compute resources by using Karpenter or [Managed Node Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html) (MNG)

#### Managed Node Groups for essential components
MNG uses Launch Templates, leverages Auto Scaling Groups, and integrates with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler.

#### On-Demand Node Group
- Set up a managed node group for On-demand instances to run critical components like the Trino coordinator and at least one worker. This setup ensures stability and reliability for core operations.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for running the Trino coordinator and an essential worker node.

#### Spot Instance Node Group
- Configure a managed node group for Spot instances to add additional worker nodes cost-effectively. Spot instances are suitable for handling variable workloads while reducing expenses.
  - **Use Case**: Best for scaling worker nodes for non SLA bound, cost-sensitive tasks.

#### Additional Configurations
- **Single AZ Deployment**: Deploy node groups within a single Availability Zone to minimize data transfer costs and reduce latency.
- **Instance Types**: Select instance types that match your workload's needs, such as r6g.4xlarge for memory-intensive workloads.

### Karpenter for Node Scaling
Karpenter provisions nodes in under 60 seconds, supports mixed instance/architecture, leverages native EC2 APIs, and offers dynamic resource allocation.

#### Node Pool Setup
Use Karpenter to create a dynamic node pool that includes both spot and on-demand instances. Apply labels to ensure Trino workers and the coordinator are spun up on the appropriate instance types (on-demand or spot) as needed.

### Mixed Instances
Configure mixed instance types within the same instance pool to enhance flexibility and ensure access to a range of instance sizes, from small to large, based on workload demands.


:::tip[Key Recommendations]
:::
- Use Karpenter: For better scaling and simplified management of Trino clusters, prefer using Karpenter. It provides faster node provisioning, enhanced flexibility with mixed instance types, and better resource efficiency. Karpenter delivers superior scaling capabilities compared to MNG, making it the preferred choice for scaling secondary(worker) nodes in analytics applications.
- Dedicated Nodes: Deploy one Trino pod per node to fully utilize available resources.
- DaemonSet Resource Allocation: Reserve enough CPU and memory for essential system DaemonSets to maintain node stability.
- Coordinator Placement: Always run the Trino coordinator on an on-demand node to guarantee reliability.
- Worker Distribution: Use a mix of On-Demand and Spot instances for worker nodes to balance cost-effectiveness with availability.
- Managed Node Groups Usage : MNG should be used for components of the workloads resiliency purposes and other components of the cluster like observability tools.

<CollapsibleContent header={<span><h2>Trino on EKS Setup</h2></span>}>
Helm streamlines your Trino deployment on EKS. We recommend installing through Helm using either the [official Helm chart](https://github.com/trinodb/charts) or community charts for configuration management.

## Setup

* Install Trino using the official Helm chart or community charts
* Create distinct Helm releases for each cluster (ETL, Interactive, BI)

### Configuration Steps

* Define unique `values.yaml` files per cluster
* Configure pod resources:
  * Set CPU/memory requests
  * Set CPU/memory limits
  * Specify coordinator resources
  * Specify worker resources
* Set pod scheduling:
  * Configure nodeSelector
  * Configure affinity rules

### Deployment

Use separate Helm configurations for each workload type, with their respective values files. For example
```
# ETL Cluster
helm install etl-trino trino-chart -f etl-values.yaml

# Interactive Cluster
helm install interactive-trino trino-chart -f interactive-values.yaml

# BI Cluster
helm install analytics-trino trino-chart -f analytics-values.yaml
```

Trino operates as a distributed query engine with a massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. The system consists of two primary components: a coordinator and multiple workers.

#### The coordinator serves as the central management node that:

- Handles incoming queries
- Parses and plans query execution
- Schedules and monitors workloads
- Manages worker nodes
- Consolidates results for end-users

#### Workers are execution nodes that:

- Execute assigned tasks
- Process data from various sources
- Share intermediate results
- Communicate with data source connectors
- Register with the coordinator through a discovery service

When deployed on EKS, both coordinator and worker components run as pods within an EKS cluster. The system stores schemas and references in a catalog, which enables access to various data sources through specialized connectors. This architecture enables Trino to distribute query processing across multiple nodes, resulting in improved performance and scalability for large-scale data operations.


### Trino Coordinator Configuration

Coordinators handle query planning and orchestration, requiring fewer resources than worker nodes. Coordinator pods need fewer resources than workers as they focus on query planning rather than data processing. Below are the key configuration settings for high availability and efficient resource usage.

#### Resource Configuration sufficient for query planning and coordination tasks

* Memory: 40Gi
* CPU: 4-6 cores

#### High Availability Settings

* Replicas: 2 coordinator instances
* Pod Disruption Budget: Ensures coordinator availability during maintenance
* Pod Anti-Affinity: Schedules coordinators on separate nodes
* Always configure Pod Anti-Affinity to prevent multiple coordinators from running on the same node, improving fault tolerance.

### Exchange Manager Configuration

- Handles intermediate data during query execution.
- Offloads data to external storage to improve fault tolerance and scalability.

#### Configuring Exchange Manager with S3

#### S3 Settings
- Set to `s3://your-exchange-bucket`
- `exchange.s3.region`: Set to your AWS region
- `exchange.s3.iam-role`: Use IAM roles for S3 access
- `exchange.s3.max-error-retries`: Increase for resilience
- `exchange.s3.upload.part-size`: Adjust to optimize performance (e.g., 64MB)
#### Recommendations
- Security - Ensure IAM roles have least privilege necessary
- Performance - Tune `upload.part-size` and concurrent connections
- Cost Management - Monitor S3 costs and implement lifecycle policies

## Trino Pod Resource Requests vs Limits

Kubernetes uses resource requests and limits to manage container resources effectively. Here's how to optimize them for different Trino pod types:

### Worker Pods

- Set resources.requests slightly lower than resources.limits (e.g., 10-20% difference).
- This approach ensures efficient resource allocation while preventing resource exhaustion.

### Coordinator Pods

- Configure resource limits 20-30% higher than requests.
- This strategy accommodates occasional usage spikes, providing burst capacity while maintaining predictable scheduling.

### Benefits of This Strategy

- Improves scheduling: Kubernetes makes informed decisions based on accurate resource requests, optimizing pod placement.
- Protects resources: Well-defined limits prevent resource exhaustion, safeguarding other cluster workloads.
- Handles bursts: Higher limits allow smooth management of transient resource spikes.
- Enhances stability: Appropriate resource allocation reduces the risk of pod evictions and improves overall cluster stability.


### AutoScaling Configuration

We recommend implementing [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) for event-driven scaling in Trino clusters to enable dynamic workload management. The combination of KEDA and Karpenter on Amazon EKS creates a powerful autoscaling solution that eliminates scaling challenges. While KEDA manages fine-grained pod scaling based on real-time metrics, Karpenter handles efficient node provisioning. Together, they replace manual scaling processes, delivering both improved performance and cost optimization.

#### Configuring Keda
- Add Keda helm release to the cluster
- Add JVM / JMX Exporter configuration to Trino Helm value, enable serviceMonitor
```
configProperties: |-
      hostPort: localhost:{{- .Values.jmx.registryPort }}
      startDelaySeconds: 0
      ssl: false
      lowercaseOutputName: false
      lowercaseOutputLabelNames: false
      whitelistObjectNames: ["trino.execution:name=QueryManager","trino.execution:name=SqlTaskManager","trino.execution.executor:name=TaskExecutor","trino.memory:name=ClusterMemoryManager","java.lang:type=Runtime","trino.memory:type=ClusterMemoryPool,name=general","java.lang:type=Memory","trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=general"]
      autoExcludeObjectNameAttributes: true
      excludeObjectNameAttributes:
        "java.lang:type=OperatingSystem":
          - "ObjectName"
        "java.lang:type=Runtime":
          - "ClassPath"
          - "SystemProperties"
      rules:
      - pattern: ".*"
```
- Deploy KEDA scaledObject for trino, tracking CPU and QueuedQueries. The 'target' CPU percentage here is set at 85%, to leverage the physical cores of Graviton instances.
```
triggers:
  - type: cpu
    metricType: Utilization
    metadata:
      value: '85'  # Target CPU utilization percentage
  - type: prometheus
    metricType: Value
    metadata:
      serverAddress: http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.kube-prometheus-stack.svc.cluster.local:9090
      threshold: '1'
      metricName: queued_queries
      query: sum by (job) (avg_over_time(trino_execution_QueryManager_QueuedQueries{job="trino"}[1m]))
```

## File Caching

File caching provides three major benefits to storage systems and query operations. First, it reduces the storage load by preventing repetitive retrievals of the same files, as cached files can be reused across multiple queries on the same worker. Second, it can significantly improve query performance by eliminating repeated network transfers and allowing access to local file copies, particularly beneficial when the original storage is in a different network or region. Finally, it leads to reduced query costs by minimizing network traffic and storage access.

This is a basic configuration for implementing File Caching.

```
fs.cache.enabled=true
fs.cache.directories=/tmp/cache/
fs.cache.preferred-hosts-count=10 # The cluster size determines the host count. We recommend keeping host count small to maintain optimal performance.
```

:::note
Configure instances with Local SSD storage for cache directories to significantly improve I/O speed and overall query performance.

## Compute Choices

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers diverse computing options through its instance families and processors, including standard, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and I/O-optimized configurations. You can purchase these instances through [flexible pricing models](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/): On-Demand, Compute Savings Plan, Reserved, or Spot instances. Choosing the appropriate instance type optimizes your costs, maximizes performance, and supports sustainability goals. EKS enables you to match these compute resources precisely to your workload requirements. For Trino distributed clusters specifically, your compute selection directly impacts cluster performance.

:::tip[Key Recommendations]
:::
- Use [AWS Graviton-based Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/): Graviton instances lowers cost of instances while improving performance, it also helps to meet with sustainability goals
- Use Karpenter: For better scaling and simplified management of Trino clusters, prefer using Karpenter.
- Diversify the Spot Instances to maximize your savings. [More details can be found in EC2 Spot Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/best-practices-to-optimize-your-amazon-ec2-spot-instances-usage/). Use [Fault-Tolerant execution](http://localhost:3000/data-on-eks/docs/blueprints/distributed-databases/trino#example-3-optional-fault-tolerant-execution-in-trino) with EC2 Spot Instances

<CollapsibleContent header={<span><h2>Networking  Best Practices</h2></span>}>

## Plan for networking

Trino's distributed nature across pods requires implementation of networking best practices to ensure optimal performance. Proper implementation improves resiliency, prevents IP exhaustion, reduces pod initialization errors, and minimizes latency. Pod networking forms the core of Kubernetes operations. Amazon EKS uses the VPC CNI plugin, operating in underlay mode where pods and hosts share the network layer. This ensures consistent IP addressing across both cluster and VPC environments.

### VPC CNI Addon
The Amazon VPC CNI plugin can be customized to manage IP address allocation efficiently. By default, the Amazon VPC CNI assigns two Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) per node. These ENIs reserve numerous IP addresses, particularly on larger instance types. Since Trino typically needs only one pod per node plus a few IP addresses for DaemonSet pods (for logging and networking), you can configure the CNI to limit IP address allocation and reduce overhead.

The following settings to the VPC CNI Addon can be applied using the EKS API, Terraform, or any other Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool. For more in-depth details, refer to the official documentation:VPC CNI Prefix and IP Target.

### Configuring the VPC CNI Addon

Limit IP Addresses per Node by adjusting the configuration to allocate only the required number of IPs:
- MINIMUM_IP_TARGET: Set this to the expected number of pods per node (e.g., 30).
- WARM_IP_TARGET: Set to 1 to keep the warm IP pool minimal.
- ENABLE_PREFIX_DELEGATION: Improve IP address efficiency by assigning IP prefixes to worker nodes rather than individual secondary IP addresses. This approach reduces Network Address Usage (NAU) within your VPC by utilizing a smaller, more concentrated pool of IP addresses.

#### Sample VPC CNI Configuration

```
vpc-cni = {
  preserve = true
  configuration_values = jsonencode({
    env = {
      MINIMUM_IP_TARGET           = "30"
      WARM_IP_TARGET              = "1"
      ENABLE_PREFIX_DELEGATION    = "true"
    }
  })
}
```

:::tip[Key Recommendations]
:::
<b>Enable prefix delegation:</b> VPC CNI plugin supports prefix delegation, which assigns blocks of 16 IPv4 addresses (/28 prefix) to each node. This feature reduces the number of ENIs required per node. By using prefix delegation, you can lower your EC2 Network Address Usage (NAU), reduce network management complexity, and decrease operational costs.
