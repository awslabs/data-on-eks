# Data Generation for Running Spark Benchmark Tests on Amazon EKS

The following guide provides instructions on how to generate the data set for running the TPCDS benchmark tests for Spark.

<CollapsibleContent header={<h2><span>Deploying the Solution</span></h2>}>

In this [example](https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks/tree/main/analytics/terraform/spark-k8s-operator), you will provision the following resources required to run Spark Jobs with open source Spark Operator and Apache YuniKorn.

This example deploys an EKS Cluster running the Spark K8s Operator into a new VPC.

- Creates a new sample VPC, 2 Private Subnets and 2 Public Subnets
- Creates Internet gateway for Public Subnets and NAT Gateway for Private Subnets
- Creates EKS Cluster Control plane with public endpoint (for demo reasons only) with core managed node group, on-demand node group and Spot node group for Spark workloads.
- Deploys Metrics server, Cluster Autoscaler, Spark-k8s-operator, Apache Yunikorn, Karpenter, Grafana, AMP and Prometheus server.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the following tools on your machine.

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

### Deploy

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks.git
cd data-on-eks
export DOEKS_HOME=$(pwd)
```

If DOEKS_HOME is ever unset, you can always set it manually using `export
DATA_ON_EKS=$(pwd)` from your data-on-eks directory.

Export the following environment variables to set the minimum and desired number of ssd enabled c5d 12xlarge instances. In our tests, we've set both of these to `6`. Please adjust the number of instances as per your requirement and set up.

```bash
export TF_VAR_spark_benchmark_ssd_min_size=6
export TF_VAR_spark_benchmark_ssd_desired_size=6
```

Navigate into one of the example directories and run `install.sh` script.

```bash
cd ${DOEKS_HOME}/analytics/terraform/spark-k8s-operator
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Now create an S3_BUCKET variable that holds the name of the bucket created
during the install. This bucket will be used in later examples to store output
data. If S3_BUCKET is ever unset, you can run the following commands again.

```bash
export S3_BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw s3_bucket_id_spark_history_server)
echo $S3_BUCKET
```
