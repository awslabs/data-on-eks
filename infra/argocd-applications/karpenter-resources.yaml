# Karpenter Resources are deployed directly via Terraform kubectl_manifest
# Not via ArgoCD since they are infrastructure-level resources
# See: infra/terraform/argocd-addons/karpenter-resources.tf
#
# This approach is ONLY for Karpenter Resources
# All other addons use the standard ArgoCD + Helm approach
