This platform will allow you to run Spark interactive Session in Jupyter notebook with EMR Studio supported by EMR on EKS and run Spark jobs with EMR on EKS. The architecture below shows the infrasturcture you will deploy using the CDK and ARA library.

This library contains AWS CDK constructs (L3) that can be used to quickly provision analytics solutions in demos, prototypes, proofs of concept, and end-to-end reference architectures. The API of ARA Library is defined here. In our case the library help you deploy an infrastructure optimised for Apache Spark running on EKS leveraging EMR on EKS. The infrastructure will out of the box provide you with pod collocation to reduce network traffic, deploy nodegroup in a single AZ to reduce cross AZ traffic during shuffle, use dedicated instances for EMR on EKS, use optimized instances for memory intensive jobs, use spot and on-demand instances for non-critical job and for critical jobs.

The example is in the directory examples/emr-eks-app that you will find in the repository you will clone below. Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-analytics-reference-architecture.git  This solution will deploy the following: EKS cluster and a set of Nodegroups: Managed Nodegroup called tooling for running system critical pods. e.g., Cluster Autoscaler, CoreDNS, EBS CSI Driver..Three Managed Nodegroup called critical for critical jobs, each in one AZ, this nodegroup use on-demand instancesThree Managed Nodegroup called non-critical for non-critical jobs, each in one AZ, this nodegroup use spot instancesThree Managed Nodegroup called notebook-driver for non-critical jobs, each in one AZ, this nodegroup use on-demand instances to have a stable driver.Three Managed Nodegroup called notebook-executor for non-critical jobs, each in one AZ, this nodegroup use spot instances instances for executors. Enable EKS Cluster to be with with EMR on EKS service EMR Virtual Cluster called batchjob, used to submitted jobs EMR Virtual Cluster called emrvcplatform, used to submitted jobs EMR Studio called platform A managed endpoint, called platform-myendpoint , to use with Jupyter notebooks you will create in the EMR Studio Execution role to use when submiting jobs with EMR on EKS start-job-run Execution role to use with managed endpoint. pod templates stored in an S3 bucket called &quot;EKS-CLUSTER-NAME-emr-eks-assets-ACCOUNT-ID-REGION&quot; "},{"title":"Customize​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EMR on EKS Data Platform with AWS CDK","url":"/data-on-eks/blog/Data Platform with AWS CDK#customize","content":"The infrastructure described above is defined in emr-eks-app/lib/emr-eks-app-stack.ts. If you want to customize it you can change the values in it. For example, you can chose not to create the default nodegroup to use for jobs, in this case you can set the defaultNodeGroups parameter to false in the EmrEksCluster. You can also call the addEmrEksNodegroup method to define your own nodegroups with specific labels, instances or taints. The addEmrEksNodegroup method is defined here. You can also create your own execution role through the createExecutionRole method or create a managed endpoint to attach it to an EMR Studio you deployed outside of the ARA library. In order to simplify this example we use IAM authentication with IAM user for EMR Studio. If you would like to use a user in the AWS IAM Identity Center you can change studioAuthMode in the NotebookPlatform construct. Below you will can see the code snipet that you need to change. const notebookPlatform = new ara.NotebookPlatform(this, 'platform-notebook', { emrEks: emrEks, eksNamespace: 'dataanalysis', studioName: 'platform', studioAuthMode: ara.StudioAuthMode.IAM, });  "},{"title":"Deploy​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EMR on EKS Data Platform with AWS CDK","url":"/data-on-eks/blog/Data Platform with AWS CDK#deploy","content":"Before you run the solution, you MUST change the eksAdminRoleArn of the props object of EmrEksCluster in lib/emr-eks-app-stack.ts. This role allows you to interact manage EKS cluster and should have be allowed at least the IAM action eks:AccessKubernetesApi. You need to also change the identityName in the addUser method of the NotebookPlatform construct. The identityName MUST BE a valid IAM username that you use. Below you will can see the code snipet that you need to change. notebookPlatform.addUser([{ identityName:'', notebookManagedEndpoints: [{ emrOnEksVersion: 'emr-6.8.0-latest', executionPolicy: emrEksPolicy, managedEndpointName: 'myendpoint' }], }]);  Last you shold also update the IAM policies passed to the createExecutionRole, if you want to process data that is in S3 buckets that you own. Navigate into one of the example directories and run cdk synth --profile YOUR-AWS-PROFILE cd examples/emr-eks-app npm install cdk synth --profile YOUR-AWS-PROFILE  Once the synth is completed you can deploy the infrastructrue with the following command: cdk deploy  At the end of the deployment you will see output like follow:  In the output you will find job sample configurations with the best practices for Spark on Kubernetes like dynamicAllocation and pod collocation.

Tools such as Apache Spark and DASK are designed to run on a cluster of machines, making them well-suited for deployment on Kubernetes. The Spark Operator for Kubernetes is a popular Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of Apache Spark on Kubernetes. By using the Spark Operator, organizations can take advantage of features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of their data analytics pipelines.

Running streaming platforms on Kubernetes can provide a number of benefits for organizations looking to process and analyze real-time data streams. Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of streaming platforms. There are a number of popular streaming platforms that have emerged to support this use case, including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Pulsar. These platforms make it easy to process and analyze real-time data streams in a containerized environment, and provide features such as real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and fault-tolerance. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can focus on building and processing their streaming data pipelines, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With its robust ecosystem of tools and support for a wide range of use cases, Kubernetes is becoming an increasingly popular choice for running streaming platforms in production.

Since the lifecycle of EBS volumes is independent of Kafka brokers, if a broker fails and needs to be replaced, the EBS volume attached to the failed broker can be reattached to a replacement broker. Most of the replicated data for the replacement broker is already available in the EBS volume, and does not need to be copied over the network from another broker. This avoids most of the replication traffic required to bring the replacement broker up to speed with current operations.Just in time scale up: The characteristics of EBS volumes can be modified while they’re in use. Broker storage can be automatically scaled over time rather than provisioning storage for peak or adding additional brokers.Optimized for frequently-accessed-throughput-intensive workloads: Volume types such as st1 can be a good fit since these volumes are offered at a relatively low cost, support a large 1 MiB I/O block size, max IOPS of 500/volume, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.
