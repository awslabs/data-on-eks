Our test data is a TPC-DS compliant dataset based on the TPC-DS Standard Specification, Revision 2.4 document, which outlines the business model and data schema, relationship, and more. As the whitepaper illustrates, the test data contains 7 fact tables and 17 dimension tables, with an average of 18 columns. The schema consists of essential retailer business information, such as customer, order, and item data for the classic sales channels: store, catalog, and internet. This source data is designed to represent real-world business scenarios with common data skews, such as seasonal sales and frequent names. Additionally, the TPC-DS benchmark offers a set of discrete scaling points (scale factors) based on the approximate size of the raw data. In our test, we chose the 3 TB scale factor, which produces 17.7 billion records, approximately 924 GB compressed data in Parquet file format."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Test approach\nA single test session consists of 104 Spark SQL queries that were run sequentially.
