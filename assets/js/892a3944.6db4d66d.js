Our test data is a TPC-DS compliant dataset based on the TPC-DS Standard Specification, Revision 2.4 document, which outlines the business model and data schema, relationship, and more. As the whitepaper illustrates, the test data contains 7 fact tables and 17 dimension tables, with an average of 18 columns. The schema consists of essential retailer business information, such as customer, order, and item data for the classic sales channels: store, catalog, and internet. This source data is designed to represent real-world business scenarios with common data skews, such as seasonal sales and frequent names. Additionally, the TPC-DS benchmark offers a set of discrete scaling points (scale factors) based on the approximate size of the raw data.
