# This is the executor pod template for the XGBoost example.
# The executor pod is launched in the same node group as the Spark executor.
# Make sure to update the availability zone and node group name to match your cluster.
# The toleration is required to allow the executor pod to be scheduled on the same node as the Spark executor.
# /local1 is the local disk mount point on the node. This is used for shuffle data.
