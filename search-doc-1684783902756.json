Fault tolerance: Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for handling node failures and ensuring high availability of your Ray cluster. Resource allocation: With Kubernetes, you can easily allocate and manage resources for your Ray workloads, ensuring that they have access to the necessary resources for optimal performance. Portability: By deploying Ray on Kubernetes, you can run your workloads across multiple clouds and on-premises data centers, making it easy to move your applications as needed. Monitoring: Kubernetes provides rich monitoring capabilities, including metrics and logging, making it easy to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

It requires users to deploy a collection agent such as Prometheus server or an OpenTelemetry agent such as the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in their cluster to perform this task. One of the easiest ways to collect Prometheus metrics from Amazon EKS workloads is by using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) collector. Customers can deploy the ADOT Collector in a variety of deployment models and easily manage configuration using the ADOT Operator. The ADOT Operator is also available as an EKS Add-Onfor easier deployment and management. Read our launch blogto learn about this feature. The best way to provision permissions for resources running on EKS clusters is through IRSA. The command below will use AWS CloudFormation to create a K8s namespace called prometheus, create a K8s Service Account called amp-iamproxy-ingest-role, create a new IAM Role with the AmazonPrometheusRemoteWriteAccess policy attached to it. It will also create a trust policy between the EKS cluster's IAM OpenID Connect Provider (OIDC) and the created Service Account.

Running distributed databases and query engines on Kubernetes can provide a number of benefits for organizations looking to manage and process large amounts of data in real-time. Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of these systems. There are a number of popular distributed databases and query engines that have emerged to support this use case, including Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, and Apache Presto. These systems make it easy to manage and process large amounts of data in real-time, and provide features such as scalability, high availability, and real-time data processing. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can simplify and automate the deployment, scaling, and management of these complex systems, freeing up resources to focus on other areas of the business.

Applications that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster can access the PostgreSQL database using a service which is solely managed by the operator, without having to worry about changes of the primary role following a failover or a switchover. Applications that reside outside the Kubernetes cluster, need to configure a Service or Ingress object to expose the Postgres via TCP. Web applications can take advantage of the native connection pooler based on PgBouncer.

Check examples folder for all kubernetes manifests. Storage​ For running a highly scalable and durable self-managed PostgreSQL database on Kubernetes with Amazon EKS and EC2, it is recommended to use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes that provide high performance and fault tolerance. The preferred EBS volume types for this use case are: 1.Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 or io1): Designed for I/O-intensive workloads such as databases.Offers consistent and low-latency performance.Allows you to provision a specific number of IOPS (input/output operations per second) according to your requirements.Provides up to 64,000 IOPS per volume and 1,000 MB/s throughput, making it suitable for demanding database workloads. 2.General Purpose SSD (gp3 or gp2): Suitable for most workloads and offers a balance between performance and cost.Provides a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s throughput per volume, which can be increased if needed (up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s for gp3).Recommended for less I/O-intensive database workloads or when cost is a primary concern. You can find both storageclass template in examples folder. kubectl create -f examples/storageclass.yaml kubectl create -f examples/auth-prod.yaml  As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster you need to apply a configuration file that defines your desired Cluster.

Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of streaming platforms. There are a number of popular streaming platforms that have emerged to support this use case, including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Pulsar. These platforms make it easy to process and analyze real-time data streams in a containerized environment, and provide features such as real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and fault-tolerance. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can focus on building and processing their streaming data pipelines, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

This ensures that the Flink jobs are isolated and have their own resources.Use high-quality storage: Store Flink checkpoints and savepoints in high-quality storage such as Amazon S3 or another durable external storage. These storage options are reliable, scalable, and offer durability for large volumes of data.Optimize resource allocation: Allocate sufficient resources to Flink jobs to ensure optimal performance. This can be done by setting resource requests and limits for Flink containers.Proper network isolation: Use Kubernetes Network Policies to isolate Flink jobs from other workloads running on the same Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that Flink jobs have the required network access without being impacted by other workloads.Configure Flink optimally: Tune Flink settings according to your use case. For example, adjust Flink's parallelism settings to ensure that Flink jobs are scaled appropriately based on the size of the input data.Use checkpoints and savepoints: Use checkpoints for periodic snapshots of Flink application state and savepoints for more advanced use cases such as upgrading or downgrading the application.Store checkpoints and savepoints in the right places: Store checkpoints in distributed file systems or key-value stores like Amazon S3 or another durable external storage.

Since the lifecycle of EBS volumes is independent of Kafka brokers, if a broker fails and needs to be replaced, the EBS volume attached to the failed broker can be reattached to a replacement broker. Most of the replicated data for the replacement broker is already available in the EBS volume, and does not need to be copied over the network from another broker. This avoids most of the replication traffic required to bring the replacement broker up to speed with current operations.Just in time scale up: The characteristics of EBS volumes can be modified while they’re in use. Broker storage can be automatically scaled over time rather than provisioning storage for peak or adding additional brokers.Optimized for frequently-accessed-throughput-intensive workloads: Volume types such as st1 can be a good fit since these volumes are offered at a relatively low cost, support a large 1 MiB I/O block size, max IOPS of 500/volume, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.

Apache NiFi provides a GUI based interface for building and managing data flows, making it easier for non-technical users. It also offers robust security features, including SSL, SSH, and fine-grained access control, to ensure the safe and secure transfer of sensitive data.
