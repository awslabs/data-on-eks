It’s enabled by default with Amazon EMR on EKS. It helps run Spark workloads faster, leading to lower running costs. It includes multiple performance optimization features, such as Adaptive Query Execution (AQE), dynamic partition pruning, flattening scalar subqueries, bloom filter join, and more.  In addition to the cost benefit brought by the EMR runtime for Spark, Amazon EMR on EKS can take advantage of other AWS features to further optimize cost. For example, you can run Amazon EMR on EKS jobs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances, providing up to 90% cost savings when compared to On-Demand Instances. Also, Amazon EMR on EKS supports Arm-based Graviton EC2 instances, which creates a 15% performance improvement and up to 30% cost savings when compared a Graviton2-based M6g to M5 instance type.  The recent graceful executor decommissioning feature makes Amazon EMR on EKS workloads more robust by enabling Spark to anticipate Spot Instance interruptions. Without the need to recompute or rerun impacted Spark jobs, Amazon EMR on EKS can further reduce job costs via critical stability and performance improvements.  Additionally, through container technology, Amazon EMR on EKS offers more options to debug and monitor Spark jobs. For example, you can choose Spark History Server, Amazon CloudWatch, or Amazon Managed Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana (for more details, refer to the Monitoring and Logging workshop). Optionally, you can use familiar command line tools such as kubectl to interact with a job processing environment and observe Spark jobs in real time, which provides a fail-fast and productive development experience.  Amazon EMR on EKS supports multi-tenant needs and offers application-level security control via a job execution role. It enables seamless integrations to other AWS native services without a key-pair set up in Amazon EKS. The simplified security design can reduce your engineering overhead and lower the risk of data breach. Furthermore, Amazon EMR on EKS handles security and performance patches so you can focus on building your applications.

The solution uses unmodified TPC-DS data schema and table relationships, but derives queries from TPC-DS to support the Spark SQL test case. It is not comparable to other published TPC-DS benchmark results.  Key concepts Transaction Processing Performance Council-Decision Support (TPC-DS) is a decision support benchmark that is used to evaluate the analytical performance of big data technologies. Our test data is a TPC-DS compliant dataset based on the TPC-DS Standard Specification, Revision 2.4 document, which outlines the business model and data schema, relationship, and more. As the whitepaper illustrates, the test data contains 7 fact tables and 17 dimension tables, with an average of 18 columns. The schema consists of essential retailer business information, such as customer, order, and item data for the classic sales channels: store, catalog, and internet. This source data is designed to represent real-world business scenarios with common data skews, such as seasonal sales and frequent names. Additionally, the TPC-DS benchmark offers a set of discrete scaling points (scale factors) based on the approximate size of the raw data. In our test, we chose the 3 TB scale factor, which produces 17.7 billion records, approximately 924 GB compressed data in Parquet file format.  Test approach A single test session consists of 104 Spark SQL queries that were run sequentially. To get a fair comparison, each session of different deployment types, such as Amazon EMR on EKS, was run three times. The average runtime per query from these three iterations is what we analyze and discuss in this post. Most importantly, it derives two summarized metrics to represent our Spark performance:  Total execution time – The sum of the average runtime from three iterations Geomean – The geometric mean of the average runtime Test results In the test result summary (see the following figure), we discovered that the Amazon EMR-optimized Spark runtime used by Amazon EMR on EKS is approximately 2.1 times better than the open-source Spark on Amazon EKS in geometric mean and 3.5 times faster by the total runtime.    The following figure breaks down the performance summary by queries. We observed that EMR runtime for Spark was faster in every query compared to open-source Spark. Query q67 was the longest query in the performance test. The average runtime with open-source Spark was 1019.09 seconds. However, it took 150.02 seconds with Amazon EMR on EKS, which is 6.8 times faster. The highest performance gain in these long-running queries was q72—319.70 seconds (open-source Spark) vs. 26.86 seconds (Amazon EMR on EKS), a 11.9 times improvement.

These best practices will cover various aspects, including cluster configuration, resource management, data storage, security, monitoring, and more. By following these recommended practices, you can optimize the performance, reliability, and security of your data and ML workloads on EKS. Stay tuned for valuable insights and guidance on how to achieve the best outcomes in your EKS environment. Through working with AWS customers, we’ve identified a number of Best Practices that we have recommended for Spark or other large data workloads. We continue to collect and post those recommendations here. Because this is an ongoing effort, please open an Issue or Pull Request if you find something outdated so we can update it. These Data on EKS Best Practices are meant to expand upon the EKS Best Practices Guide for data-centric use cases (e.g., batch processing, stream processing, and machine learning) and we recommend reviewing the EKS Best Practices as a primer before diving into these. The Data on EKS Best Practices are not comprehensive and we recommend you read through the guidance and determine what’s best for your environment. The recommendations here were built from working with customers one of two designs (listed below). Each data use case (e.g., batch processing, stream processing) aligns more closely to one of the two cluster designs, which we will call out in our recommendations. The first design is dynamic clusters that scale, or “churn”, a lot. These clusters run batch processing with Spark, or other workloads that create pods for a relatively short time but can vary greatly on the scale at any given time. These clusters create and delete resources like pods and nodes, or churn, at a high rate which adds unique pressures to Kubernetes and critical components.The other design is “static” clusters. These clusters are often large but have less volatile scaling behavior and are generally running longer-lived jobs, like streaming or training. Avoid interruptions for these workloads is a key concern and care must be taken when making changes. When we talk about large clusters or high rates of churn, it’s difficult to put a specific number to those phrases because of the complexity of kubernetes scalability. In general, these clusters have &gt;500 nodes and &gt;5000 pods, or are creating/destroying hundreds of resources a minute; however, the scalability constraints are different for every workload (even between two different Spark jobs).","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Preload container images into data volumes with EBS Snapshots","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/bestpractices/preload-container-images","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Overview of this script​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Preload container images into data volumes with EBS Snapshots","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/bestpractices/preload-container-images#overview-of-this-script","content":"   Launch an EC2 instance with Bottlerocket for EKS AMI.Access to instance via Amazon System ManagerPull images to be cached in this EC2 using Amazon System Manager Run Command.Shut down the instance, build the EBS snapshot for the data volume.Terminate the instance.

The ability to monitor GPU usage in real-time, identify trends, and detect anomalies can significantly impact performance tuning, troubleshooting, and efficient resource utilization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator plays a key role in GPU observability. It automates the deployment of the necessary components to run GPU workloads on Kubernetes. One of its components, the DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) Exporter, is an open-source project that exports GPU metrics in a format that can be ingested by Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution. These metrics include GPU temperature, memory usage, GPU utilization, and more. The DCGM Exporter allows you to monitor these metrics on a per-GPU basis, providing granular visibility into your GPU resources.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator, in combination with the DCGM Exporter, exports GPU metrics to a Prometheus server. With its flexible query language, Prometheus allows you to slice and dice data to generate insights into resource usage patterns.  However, Prometheus is not designed for long-term data storage. This is where the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) comes into play. It provides a fully-managed, secure, and scalable service for Prometheus that makes it easy to analyze operational data at scale without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.  Visualizing these metrics and creating informative dashboards is where Grafana excels. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, offering rich visualizations to represent collected metrics intuitively. When combined with Prometheus, Grafana can display the GPU metrics collected by the DCGM Exporter in a user-friendly manner.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator is configured to export metrics to the Prometheus server, which then remote-writes these metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). As a user, you can log into the Grafana WebUI, deployed as part of the blueprint, and add AMP as a data source. Following this, you can import the open-source GPU monitoring dashboard that presents GPU metrics in an easily digestible format, facilitating real-time performance monitoring and resource optimization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator: Installed on your Kubernetes cluster, the NVIDIA GPU Operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of GPU resources. It deploys NVIDIA drivers and the DCGM Exporter on each GPU-equipped node.DCGM Exporter: The DCGM Exporter runs on each node, collecting GPU metrics and exposing them to Prometheus.Prometheus: Prometheus is a time-series database that collects metrics from various sources, including the DCGM Exporter. It pulls metrics from the exporter at regular intervals and stores them. In this setup, you would configure Prometheus to remote-write the collected metrics to AMP.Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP): AMP is a fully-managed Prometheus service provided by AWS. It takes care of long-term storage, scalability, and security of your Prometheus data.Grafana: Grafana is a visualization tool that can query AMP for the collected metrics, and display them on informative dashboards.  In this blueprint, we leverage DCGM to write GPU metrics to both Prometheus and Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). To verify the GPU metrics, you can use Grafana by running the following command:  kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n grafana `` Login to Grafana using `admin` as the username, and retrieve the password from Secrets Manager using the following AWS CLI command: ```bash aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id emr-spark-rapids-grafana --region us-west-2   Once logged in, add the AMP datasource to Grafana and import the Open Source GPU monitoring dashboard.

When designing the VPC for your environment plan for more IP addresses than just your pods to accommodate this warm pool.

As the VPC CNI launches it tries to provision a Warm Pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to Kubernetes Pods (More details in the EKS Best Practices Guide).  The VPC CNI must make AWS EC2 API calls (like AssignPrivateIpV4Address and DescribeNetworkInterfaces) to assign those additional IPs and ENIs to the worker node. When the EKS cluster scales out the number of Nodes or Pods there could be a spike in the number of these EC2 API calls. This surge of calls could encounter rate throttling from the EC2 API to help the performance of the service, and to ensure fair usage for all Amazon EC2 customers. This rate throttling can cause the pool of IP address to be exhausted while the CNI tries to allocate more IPs.  These failures will cause errors like the one below, indicating that the provisioning of the container network namespace has failed because the VPC CNI could not provision an IP address.

For some workloads the CPU, Memory, or other resource will limit the number of Pods on that c5.18xlarge before we need more than 50 IPs.

To configure the --max-pods option you can update the userdata for your worker nodes to set this option via the --kubelet -extra-args in the bootstrap.sh script.

This means hard-coding a value for max-pods may cause problems if you change instance types or in mixed-instance environments.  In the EKS Optimized AMI releases there is a script included that can be used to help calculate the AWS Recommended max-pods value. If you’d like to automate this calculation for mixed instances you will also need to update the userdata for your instances to use the --instance-type-from-imds flag to autodiscover the instance type from instance metadata.   eks_managed_node_groups = { system = { instance_types = [&quot;m5.xlarge&quot;] min_size = 0 max_size = 5 desired_size = 3 pre_bootstrap_user_data = &lt;&lt;-EOT /etc/eks/max-pod-calc.sh --instance-type-from-imds —cni-version 1.13.4 —cni-max-eni 1 EOT bootstrap_extra_args = &quot;--use-max-pods false --kubelet-extra-args '--max-pods=&lt;your_value&gt;'&quot; }   Maxpods with Karpenter​  By default, Nodes provisioned by Karpenter will have the max pods on a node based on the node instance type.

Follow the steps below to achieve this:  Open JupyterHub in an Incognito browser window: Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in the new incognito window in web browser. Input user-2 as the username and choose any password.  Choose server options: After logging in, you’ll see the server options page. Ensure that you select the Data Science (GPU + Time-Slicing – G5) radio button and select Start.    Verify pod placement: Notice that this pod placement takes only few seconds unlike the user-1. It’s because the Kubernetes scheduler is able to place the pod on the existing g5.2xlarge node created by the user-1 pod. user-2 is also using the same docker image so there is no delay in pulling the docker image and it leveraged local cache.  Open a terminal and execute the following command to check where the new Jupyter Notebook pod has been scheduled:  kubectl get pods -n jupyterhub -owide | grep -i user   Observe that both the user-1 and user-2 pods are running on the same node. This confirms that our GPU time-slicing configuration is functioning as expected.  info Checkout the AWS blog: Building multi-tenant JupyterHub Platforms on Amazon EKS for more details  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Type2 deployment(Optional): Login into JupyterHub via Amazon Cognito​","type":1,"pageTitle":"JupyterHub on EKS","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/blueprints/ai-ml/jupyterhub#type2-deploymentoptional-login-into-jupyterhub-via-amazon-cognito","content":" Add the CNAME DNS record in ChangeIP for the JupyterHub domain with the load balancer DNS name.    info When adding the load balancer DNS name in the value field of CNAME in ChangeIP make sure to add a dot(.) at the end of the load-balancer DNS name.

To execute the task, we will use TorchX to initiate the job on two trn1.32xlarge instances, with 32 workers per instance. You can also run the same job on trn1n.32xlarge node group.  We have created three Shell scripts to automate the job execution as much as possible.  Step1: Create a Docker image for PyTorch Neuron container for BERT-large model pre-training​  This step creates a new Docker image and push this image to ECR repo. The Dockerfile handles the installation of necessary software packages, such as AWS Neuron repos, Python dependencies, and other essential tools for PyTorch and BERT pre-training. It configures various environment variables to ensure smooth execution and optimal performance. The image contains crucial components like a BERT pretraining script and requirements.txt file sourced from GitHub, both vital for the BERT pretraining process. Furthermore, it includes a basic environment test script for validation purposes. Together, this Docker image provides a comprehensive environment for efficient BERT pre-training with PyTorch while incorporating AWS Neuron optimizations.  caution This step generates an AMD64 (x86-64) Docker image with a size of 7GB or more. Therefore, it is strongly advised to utilize an AWS Cloud9/EC2 AMD64 (x86-64) instance with Docker client installed, ensuring sufficient storage capacity for this process.  caution If you are executing this script on a Cloud9 IDE/EC2 instance different from the one where the EKS Cluster is deployed, it is essential to ensure that the same IAM role is used or attached to the Cloud9 IDE/EC2 instance. Should you prefer a distinct IAM role for Cloud9 IDE/EC2, it must be added to the EKS Cluster's aws-auth config map to grant the role authorization for authenticating with the EKS Cluster. Taking these precautions will enable smooth communication between the instances and the EKS Cluster, ensuring the script functions as intended.  cd ai-ml/trainium-inferentia/examples/dp-bert-large-pretrain chmod +x 1-bert-pretrain-build-image.sh ./1-bert-pretrain-build-image.sh   Admin:~/environment/data-on-eks/ai-ml/trainium-inferentia/examples/dp-bert-large-pretrain (trainium-part2) $ ./1-bert-pretrain-build-image.sh Did you install docker on AMD64(x86-64) machine (y/n): y Enter the ECR region: us-west-2 ECR repository 'eks_torchx_test' already exists.

Step2: Copy WikiCorpus pre-training dataset for BERT model to FSx for Lustre filesystem​  In this step, we make it easy to transfer the WikiCorpus pre-training dataset, which is crucial for training the BERT model in distributed mode by multiple Trainium instances, to the FSx for Lustre filesystem. To achieve this, we will login to cmd-shell pod which includes an AWS CLI container, providing access to the filesystem.  Once you're inside the container, Copy the WikiCorpus dataset from S3 bucket (s3://neuron-s3/training_datasets/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar). The dataset is then unpacked, giving you access to its contents, ready for use in the subsequent BERT model pre-training process.  kubectl exec -i -t -n default cmd-shell -c app -- sh -c &quot;clear; (bash || ash || sh)&quot; # Once logged into the container yum install tar cd /data aws s3 cp s3://neuron-s3/training_datasets/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar . --no-sign-request chmod 744 bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar tar xvf bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar   Step3: Precompile the BERT graphs using neuron_parallel_compile​  PyTorch Neuron introduces a valuable tool known as neuron_parallel_compile, which significantly reduces graph compilation time by extracting model graphs and compiling them in parallel. This optimization technique expedites the process and results in faster model compilation. The compiled graphs are then stored on the Fsx for Lustre shared storage volume, accessible by worker nodes during model training. This efficient approach streamlines the training process and improves overall performance, making the most of PyTorch Neuron's capabilities.  Execute the following commands.This script prompts the user to configure their kubeconfig and verifies the presence of the lib folder with trn1_dist_ddp.py. It sets up Docker credentials, installs the TorchX client for Kubernetes. Using TorchX, the script runs a Kubernetes job to compile BERT graphs with optimized performance. Additionally, TorchX creates another Docker image and pushes it to the ECR repository within the same repo. This image is utilized in the subsequent pre-compiling pods, optimizing the overall BERT model training process.  cd ai-ml/trainium-inferentia/examples/dp-bert-large-pretrain chmod +x 2-bert-pretrain-precompile.sh ./2-bert-pretrain-precompile.sh   You can verify the pods status by running kubectl get pods or kubectl get vcjob. Successful output looks like below.    You can also verify the logs for the Pod once they are Succeeded. The precompilation job will run for ~15 minutes.

By using EKS, you can leverage the power and flexibility of Kubernetes to deploy and scale DataHub components, and take advantage of other AWS services and features, such as IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch, to monitor and secure the DataHub cluster.  DataHub also depends on many underlying infrastructure and services to function, including a message broker, a search engine, graph database, and a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. AWS offers a range of managed and serverless services that can meet the needs of DataHub and simplify its deployment and operation.  DataHub can use Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) as the messaging layer for metadata ingestion and consumption. MSK is a fully managed Apache Kafka service, so you don't need to handles the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of Kafka cluster.DataHub stores metadata in both relational database and a search engine.

RDS for MySQL also provides the high availability, security, and other features DataHub needs to store the metadata.For search engine, this blueprint uses Amazon OpenSearch service to provide fast and scalable search capabilities for the metadata.This blueprint deployes a Schema Registry service on EKS for DataHub.

OLAP is software technology you can use to analyze business data from different points of view. Organizations collect and store data from multiple data sources, such as websites, applications, smart meters, and internal systems. OLAP helps organizations process and benefit from a growing amount of information by combining and groups this data into categories to provide actionable insights for strategic planning. For example, a retailer stores data about all the products it sells, such as color, size, cost, and location. The retailer also collects customer purchase data, such as the name of the items ordered and total sales value, in a different system. OLAP combines the datasets to answer questions such as which color products are more popular or how product placement impacts sales. Some key benefits of Clickhouse include: Real-Time Analytics: ClickHouse can handle real-time data ingestion and analysis, making it suitable for use cases such as monitoring, logging, and event data processing.High Performance: ClickHouse is optimized for analytical workloads, providing fast query execution and high throughput.Scalability: ClickHouse is designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, allowing users to store and process petabytes of data across a distributed cluster. It supports sharding and replication for high availability and fault tolerance.Column-Oriented Storage: ClickHouse organizes data by columns rather than rows, which allows for efficient compression and faster query processing, especially for queries that involve aggregations and scans of large datasets.SQL Support: ClickHouse supports a subset of SQL, making it familiar and easy to use for developers and analysts who are already familiar with SQL-based databases.Integrated Data Formats: ClickHouse supports various data formats, including CSV, JSON, Apache Avro, and Apache Parquet, making it flexible for ingesting and querying different types of data.

Console consist of Cluster Manager, Query Explorer, Zookeeper Browser and Swagger REST API Explorer.  kubectl port-forward service/pinot-controller 9000:9000 -n pinot   This will allow you to access Apache Pinot Console like the one shown below using http://localhost:9000    Apache Pinot supports exporting metrics using Prometheus JMX exporter that is packaged within the Apache Pinot docker image. Lets ensure metrics from all Apache Pinot components are getting published to prometheus.  kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring   Navigate to the prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090, type pinot in the search box and you should be able to see all the metrics.    Next, Let's use Grafana to visualize the Apache Pinot metrics. In order to access Grafana, we need to get the grafana password from AWS Secrets Manager.  aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id pinot-on-eks-grafana | jq '.SecretString' --raw-output   Now use the port-forwarding to access Grafana at port 8080  kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-grafana 8080:80 -n monitoring   Login to grafana dashboard using admin and password retrieved in the previous step and then navigate to Dashboard and click New and then Import. Use the file pinot.json under data-on-eks/distributed-database/pinot/dashboard to create a pinot dashboard.    To learn more about the monitoring of Apache Pinot using Prometheus and Grafana use the official guide.

Applications that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster can access the PostgreSQL database using a service which is solely managed by the operator, without having to worry about changes of the primary role following a failover or a switchover. Applications that reside outside the Kubernetes cluster, need to configure a Service or Ingress object to expose the Postgres via TCP. Web applications can take advantage of the native connection pooler based on PgBouncer.

The preferred EBS volume types for this use case are:  1.Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 or io1):  Designed for I/O-intensive workloads such as databases.Offers consistent and low-latency performance.Allows you to provision a specific number of IOPS (input/output operations per second) according to your requirements.Provides up to 64,000 IOPS per volume and 1,000 MB/s throughput, making it suitable for demanding database workloads.  2.General Purpose SSD (gp3 or gp2):  Suitable for most workloads and offers a balance between performance and cost.Provides a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s throughput per volume, which can be increased if needed (up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s for gp3).Recommended for less I/O-intensive database workloads or when cost is a primary concern.  You can find both storageclass template in examples folder.  kubectl create -f examples/storageclass.yaml kubectl create -f examples/auth-prod.yaml   As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster you need to apply a configuration file that defines your desired Cluster. CloudNativePG operator offers two type of Bootstrapping a new database:  Bootstrap an empty clusterBootstrap From another cluster.  In this first example, we are going to create a new empty database cluster using initdbflags. We are going to use the template below by modifying the IAM role for IRSA configuration 1 and S3 bucket for backup restore process and WAL archiving 2.

Without fault-tolerant configuration, Trino query fails whenever any of the component tasks of the query fails due to any reason (for example, a worker node failure or termination). These failed queries have to be restarted from scratch resulting in longer execution time, compute wastage, and spend, especially for long-running queries.  When fault-tolerant execution is configured in Trino with a retry policy, intermediate exchange data is spooled in an external storage like Amazon S3 or HDFS using exchange manager. Trino then retries failed query (if retry policy is configured as &quot;QUERY&quot;) or failed tasks (if retry policy is configured as &quot;TASK&quot;). Trino's remaining workers reuse exchange manager data to retry and complete query in the event of a worker outage or other fault during query execution.  info A QUERY retry policy instructs Trino to retry whole query when an error occurs on a worker node. It is recommended to use this retry policy when the majority of the workload for the Trino cluster comprises many small queries. A TASK retry policy instructs Trino to retry individual tasks in the event of failure. It is recommended to use this policy when Trino executes large batch queries. The cluster can more efficiently retry smaller tasks within the query rather than retry the whole query.  This blueprint has deployed Trino cluster with fault-tolerant configuration with a TASK retry policy in config.properties file in coordinator and worker pods. Let's verify that by opening a bash command shell inside coordinator pod:  COORDINATOR_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l &quot;app=trino,release=trino,component=coordinator&quot; -o name -n trino) kubectl exec --stdin --tty $COORDINATOR_POD -n trino -- /bin/bash cat /etc/trino/config.properties   Output​  coordinator=true node-scheduler.include-coordinator=false http-server.http.port=8080 query.max-memory=40GB query.max-memory-per-node=4GB discovery.uri=http://localhost:8080 retry-policy=TASK exchange.compression-enabled=true query.low-memory-killer.delay=0s query.remote-task.max-error-duration=1m query.hash-partition-count=50   Blueprint has also configured exchange manager using an Amazon S3 bucket in exchange-manager.properties file in coordinator and worker pods. Let's also verify that inside coordinator pod  cat /etc/trino/exchange-manager.properties   Output​  exchange-manager.name=filesystem exchange.base-directories=s3://trino-exchange-bucket-20240215180855570800000004 exchange.s3.region=us-west-2 exchange.s3.iam-role=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:role/trino-sa-role   Please note down exchange manager S3 bucket name from above. You can explore contents of above S3 bucket in AWS Console. It will be empty when no query is running.  Now, let's exit from bash shell of the coordinator pod  exit   With below steps, we will now test fault-tolerant execution by running a select query and terminate few Trino workers when query is still running.  Let's create a trino_select_query_iceberg.sql file in the location where Trino CLI is installed and paste below SQL commands:  with inv as (select w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy ,stdev,mean, case mean when 0 then null else stdev/mean end cov from(select w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy ,stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) stdev,avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) mean from iceberg.iceberg_schema.inventory ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.item ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.warehouse ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.date_dim where inv_item_sk = i_item_sk and inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk and inv_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_year =1999 group by w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy) foo where case mean when 0 then 0 else stdev/mean end &gt; 1) select inv1.w_warehouse_sk,inv1.i_item_sk,inv1.d_moy,inv1.mean, inv1.cov ,inv2.w_warehouse_sk,inv2.i_item_sk,inv2.d_moy,inv2.mean, inv2.cov from inv inv1,inv inv2 where inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk and inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk and inv1.d_moy=4 and inv2.d_moy=4+1 and inv1.cov &gt; 1.5 order by inv1.w_warehouse_sk,inv1.i_item_sk,inv1.d_moy,inv1.mean,inv1.cov,inv2.d_moy,inv2.mean, inv2.cov;   Let's now run select query first  export TRINO_UI_DNS=$(kubectl describe ingress --namespace=trino | grep Address: | awk '{ print &quot;http://&quot;$2 }') ./trino --file 'trino_select_query_iceberg.sql' --server ${TRINO_UI_DNS} --user admin --ignore-errors   Immediately after above command, when above query is still running, open another terminal and scale down worker pods to just 1 worker, terminating all other workers with command below:  kubectl scale deployment trino-worker -n trino --replicas=1   See Trino Web UI on browser and there is only 1 active worker running now as other workers are terminated:    Go to Amazon S3 console and verify intermediate exchange data spooling in exchange manager S3 bucket with a name starting with trino-exchange-bucket.    Let's now see Trino Web UI monitor again to verify completion of the query despite of 6 failed tasks due to terminated workers (we have encircled them in RED in the screenshot below).  info Please note, number of failed tasks could be different in your Trino Web UI depending upon how many tasks were running on workers that got terminated. Also you can see different number of active workers depending upon worker pods scaled by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(HPA) using cpu utilization metric    Cleaning Up Iceberg Resources​  Let's open Trino CLI  export TRINO_UI_DNS=$(kubectl describe ingress --namespace=trino | grep Address: | awk '{ print &quot;http://&quot;$2 }') ./trino --server ${TRINO_UI_DNS} --user admin   Now, let's delete Iceberg tables and schema by running below SQL commands on Trino CLI:  drop table iceberg.iceberg_schema.warehouse; drop table iceberg.iceberg_schema.item; drop table iceberg.iceberg_schema.inventory; drop table iceberg.iceberg_schema.date_dim; drop schema iceberg.iceberg_schema;   Exit from Trino CLI with exit command.

The kubestl get pods output did not give us a good way to determine which of those Pods was the one with the application container. Also, once Pods are terminated, the Kubernetes scheduler can no longer provide any information on the job's nodes or Pods. Good thing that AWS Batch keeps a record of the job!  We can use AWS Batch's API to query for the main node's podName and other information. To get information on a specific node from an MNP job, you suffix the job ID with the pattern &quot;#&lt;NODE_INDEX&gt;&quot;. For the main node, which we defined as index &quot;0&quot; in our job definition, that would translate to the following AWS CLI command:  aws batch describe-jobs --jobs &quot;$JOB_ID&quot; --query &quot;jobs[].eksAttempts[].{nodeName: nodeName, podName: podName}&quot;   The output should be similar to the following.

Running streaming platforms on Kubernetes can provide a number of benefits for organizations looking to process and analyze real-time data streams. Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of streaming platforms. There are a number of popular streaming platforms that have emerged to support this use case, including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Pulsar. These platforms make it easy to process and analyze real-time data streams in a containerized environment, and provide features such as real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and fault-tolerance. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can focus on building and processing their streaming data pipelines, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With its robust ecosystem of tools and support for a wide range of use cases, Kubernetes is becoming an increasingly popular choice for running streaming platforms in production.

This ensures that the Flink jobs are isolated and have their own resources.Use high-quality storage: Store Flink checkpoints and savepoints in high-quality storage such as Amazon S3 or another durable external storage. These storage options are reliable, scalable, and offer durability for large volumes of data.Optimize resource allocation: Allocate sufficient resources to Flink jobs to ensure optimal performance. This can be done by setting resource requests and limits for Flink containers.Proper network isolation: Use Kubernetes Network Policies to isolate Flink jobs from other workloads running on the same Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that Flink jobs have the required network access without being impacted by other workloads.Configure Flink optimally: Tune Flink settings according to your use case. For example, adjust Flink's parallelism settings to ensure that Flink jobs are scaled appropriately based on the size of the input data.Use checkpoints and savepoints: Use checkpoints for periodic snapshots of Flink application state and savepoints for more advanced use cases such as upgrading or downgrading the application.Store checkpoints and savepoints in the right places: Store checkpoints in distributed file systems or key-value stores like Amazon S3 or another durable external storage. Store savepoints in a durable external storage like Amazon S3.

Manual recovery may be necessary if HA metadata is lost.savepoint: Use savepoint for upgrade, providing maximal safety and possibility to serve as backup/fork point. The savepoint will be created during the upgrade process. Note that the Flink job needs to be running to allow the savepoint to get created.

Since the lifecycle of EBS volumes is independent of Kafka brokers, if a broker fails and needs to be replaced, the EBS volume attached to the failed broker can be reattached to a replacement broker. Most of the replicated data for the replacement broker is already available in the EBS volume, and does not need to be copied over the network from another broker. This avoids most of the replication traffic required to bring the replacement broker up to speed with current operations.Just in time scale up: The characteristics of EBS volumes can be modified while they’re in use. Broker storage can be automatically scaled over time rather than provisioning storage for peak or adding additional brokers.Optimized for frequently-accessed-throughput-intensive workloads: Volume types such as st1 can be a good fit since these volumes are offered at a relatively low cost, support a large 1 MiB I/O block size, max IOPS of 500/volume, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.

Click to expand Mistral results partial output Prompt: [INST] Explain the theory of relativity. Response: [INST] Explain the theory of relativity. [/INST] The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the relationship between space and time, and how matter and energy interact within that framework. It is actually composed of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity, published in 1905, and the General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915. The Special Theory of Relativity is based on two postulates: the first one states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference (frames that are not accelerating); the second one asserts that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the source of the light. From these two postulates, several counter-intuitive consequences follow. For example, the length of an object contracts when it is in motion relative to an observer, and time dilation occurs, meaning that a moving clock appears to tick slower than a stationary one. These phenomena have been confirmed by numerous experiments. The General Theory of Relativity is a theory of gravitation, which extended the Special Theory of Relativity by incorporating gravity into the fabric of spacetime. In this theory, mass causes a distortion or curvature in spacetime, which is felt as a gravitational force. This is in contrast to the Newtonian view of gravity as a force acting at a distance between two masses. One of the most famous predictions of General Relativity is the bending of light by gravity, which was first observed during a solar eclipse in 1919. The theory has been extremely successful in explaining various phenomena, such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, the gravitational redshift of light, and the existence of black holes and gravitational waves. In summary, the theory of relativity is a groundbreaking theory in physics that fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. It has been incredibly successful in making accurate predictions about the natural world and has stood the test of time through numerous experiments and observations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Observability​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deploying LLMs with RayServe and vLLM","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/gen-ai/inference/GPUs/vLLM-rayserve#observability","content":" As part of this blueprint, we have also deployed the Kube Prometheus stack, which provides Prometheus server and Grafana deployments for monitoring and observability.  First, let's verify the services deployed by the Kube Prometheus stack:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack   You should see output similar to this:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kube-prometheus-stack-grafana ClusterIP 172.20.252.10 &lt;none&gt; 80/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-kube-state-metrics ClusterIP 172.20.34.181 &lt;none&gt; 8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-operator ClusterIP 172.20.186.93 &lt;none&gt; 443/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus ClusterIP 172.20.147.64 &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP,8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-node-exporter ClusterIP 172.20.171.165 &lt;none&gt; 9100/TCP 11d prometheus-operated ClusterIP None &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP 11d   After verifying the Kube Prometheus stack services, we need to configure Prometheus to monitor our Ray cluster comprehensively. This requires deploying both ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor resources:  ServiceMonitor is used to collect metrics from the Ray head node, which has a Kubernetes Service exposing its metrics endpoint.PodMonitor is necessary because KubeRay operator does not create a Kubernetes service for the Ray worker Pods. Therefore, we cannot use a ServiceMonitor to scrape metrics from worker Pods and must use PodMonitors CRD instead.  cd data-on-eks/ai-ml/jark-stack/terraform/monitoring   kubectl apply -f serviceMonitor.yaml kubectl apply -f podMonitor.yaml   Grafana and Prometheus Integration  To integrate Grafana and Prometheus with the Ray Dashboard, we set specific environment variables in the Ray cluster configuration:  env: - name: RAY_GRAFANA_HOST value: http://kube-prometheus-stack-grafana.kube-prometheus-stack.svc:80 - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST value: http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.kube-prometheus-stack.svc:9090   These environment variables are crucial for enabling the embedding of Grafana panels within the Ray Dashboard and for proper communication between Ray, Grafana, and Prometheus:  RAY_GRAFANA_HOST defines the internal Kubernetes service URL for Grafana. The Ray head pod uses this for backend health checks and communication within the cluster.RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST specifies the internal Kubernetes service URL for Prometheus, allowing Ray to query metrics when needed.  Access Prometheus Web UI  # Forward the port of Prometheus Web UI in the Prometheus server Pod. kubectl port-forward prometheus-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0 -n kube-prometheus-stack 9090:9090   Go to (YOUR_IP):9090/targets (e.g. 127.0.0.1:9090/targets). You should be able to see: podMonitor/kube-prometheus-stack/ray-workers-monitor/0 (1/1 up)serviceMonitor/kube-prometheus-stack/ray-head-monitor/0 (2/2 up)    Access Grafana  - Port-forward Grafana service: kubectl port-forward deployment/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n kube-prometheus-stack 3000:3000 # Check (YOUR_IP):3000/login for the Grafana login page (e.g. 127.0.0.1:3000/login). - Grafana Admin user admin - Get secret name from Terraform output terraform output grafana_secret_name - Get admin user password aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id &lt;grafana_secret_name_output&gt; --region $AWS_REGION --query &quot;SecretString&quot; --output text   Note: kubectl port-forward is not recommended for production use. Refer to this Grafana document for exposing Grafana behind a reverse proxy.  Import Open Source Grafana Dashboards  Create new dashboard by importing JSON file via Dashboards menu.Click 'Dashboards' icon in left panel, 'New', 'Import', then 'Upload JSON file'.Choose a JSON file. Case 1: If you are using Ray 2.24.0, you can use the sample config files in GitHub repository. The file names have a pattern of xxx_grafana_dashboard.json.Case 2: Otherwise, you should import the JSON files from /tmp/ray/session_latest/metrics/grafana/dashboards/ in the head Pod. You can use kubectl cp to copy the files from the head Pod to your local machine. Click “Import”.  TODO: Note that importing the dashboard manually is not ideal. We should find a way to import the dashboard automatically.   In the Grafana dashboard below, you can see several metrics:  Scheduler Task State displays the current number of tasks in a particular state.Active Tasks by Name shows the current number of (live) tasks with a particular name.Scheduler Actor State illustrates the current number of actors in a particular state.Active Actors by Name presents the current number of (live) actors with a particular name.

The core strength of Triton lies in its support for various backends, which provide the flexibility and power needed to handle different types of models and workloads effectively.  Once a request reaches the Triton K8s Service, it is processed by the Triton Server. The server supports dynamic batching, allowing multiple inference requests to be grouped together to optimize processing. This is particularly useful in scenarios with high throughput requirements, as it helps reduce latency and improve overall performance.  Requests are then managed by scheduled queues, ensuring that each model's inference requests are processed in an orderly manner. The Triton Server supports selective and compute model loading, which means it can dynamically load models based on the current workload and resource availability. This feature is crucial for efficiently managing the resources in a multi-model deployment.  The backbone of Triton’s inference capabilities are its various backends, including TensorRT-LLM and vLLM:  TensorRT-LLM: TensorRT-LLM backend optimizes large language model (LLM) inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Leveraging TensorRT's high-performance capabilities, it accelerates inference, providing low-latency and high-throughput performance. TensorRT is particularly well-suited for deep learning models that require intensive computational resources, making it ideal for real-time AI applications.  vLLM: vLLM backend is specifically designed to handle various LLM workloads. It offers efficient memory management and execution pipelines tailored for large models. This backend ensures that memory resources are used optimally, allowing for the deployment of very large models without running into memory bottlenecks. vLLM is crucial for applications that need to serve multiple large models simultaneously, providing a robust and scalable solution.

[/INST] Traditional machine learning models (MLMs) are trained on specific datasets and features to learn patterns and make predictions based on that data. They require labeled data for training and are limited by the size and diversity of the training data. MLMs can be effective for solving structured problems, such as image recognition or speech recognition. Very Large Language Models (vLLMs), on the other hand, are trained on vast amounts of text data using deep learning techniques. They learn to generate human-like text based on the input they receive. vLLMs can understand and generate text in a more contextually aware and nuanced way than MLMs. They can also perform a wider range of tasks, such as text summarization, translation, and question answering. However, vLLMs can be more computationally expensive and require large amounts of data and power to train. They also have the potential to generate inaccurate or biased responses if not properly managed. ========= &lt;s&gt;[INST]&lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt; Keep short answers of no more than 100 sentences. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt; Can you explain how TensorRT optimizes LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware? [/INST] TensorRT is a deep learning inference optimization tool from NVIDIA. It utilizes dynamic and static analysis to optimize deep learning models for inference on NVIDIA GPUs. For Maximum Likelihood Modeling (LLM) inference, TensorRT applies the following optimizations: 1. Model Optimization: TensorRT converts the LLM model into an optimized format, such as INT8 or FP16, which reduces memory usage and increases inference speed. 2. Engine Generation: TensorRT generates a custom engine for the optimized model, which includes kernel optimizations for specific NVIDIA GPUs. 3. Memory Optimization: TensorRT minimizes memory usage by using data layout optimizations, memory pooling, and other techniques. 4. Execution Optimization: TensorRT optimizes the execution of the engine on the GPU by scheduling and managing thread execution, reducing latency and increasing throughput. 5. I/O Optimization: TensorRT optimizes input and output data transfer between the host and the GPU, reducing the time spent on data transfer and increasing overall inference speed. 6. Dynamic Batching: TensorRT dynamically batches input data to maximize GPU utilization and reduce latency. 7. Multi-Streaming: TensorRT supports multi-streaming, allowing multiple inference requests to be processed concurrently, increasing overall throughput. 8. Profiling and Monitoring: TensorRT provides profiling and monitoring tools to help developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their models further.

It includes container insights for tracking key performance metrics such as CPU and memory utilization. Additionally, the blueprint integrates GPU metrics using NVIDIA's DCGM plugin, which is essential for monitoring high-performance GPU workloads. For machine learning models running on AWS Inferentia or Trainium, the Neuron Monitor plugin is added to capture and report Neuron-specific metrics.  All metrics, including container insights, GPU performance, and Neuron metrics, are sent to Amazon CloudWatch, where you can monitor and analyze them in real-time. After the deployment is complete, you should be able to access these metrics directly from the CloudWatch console, allowing you to manage and optimize your workloads effectively.  In addition to deploying CloudWatch EKS addon, we have also deployed the Kube Prometheus stack, which provides Prometheus server and Grafana deployments for monitoring and observability.  First, let's verify the services deployed by the Kube Prometheus stack:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack   You should see output similar to this:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kube-prometheus-stack-grafana ClusterIP 172.20.252.10 &lt;none&gt; 80/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-kube-state-metrics ClusterIP 172.20.34.181 &lt;none&gt; 8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-operator ClusterIP 172.20.186.93 &lt;none&gt; 443/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus ClusterIP 172.20.147.64 &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP,8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-node-exporter ClusterIP 172.20.171.165 &lt;none&gt; 9100/TCP 11d prometheus-operated ClusterIP None &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP 11d   To expose the NVIDIA Triton server metrics, we have deployed a metrics service(nvidia-triton-server-triton-inference-server-metrics) on port 8080. Verify it by running  kubectl get svc -n triton-vllm   The output should be:  kubectl get svc -n triton-vllm NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nvidia-triton-server-triton-inference-server ClusterIP 172.20.193.97 &lt;none&gt; 8000/TCP,8001/TCP,8002/TCP 34m nvidia-triton-server-triton-inference-server-metrics ClusterIP 172.20.5.247 &lt;none&gt; 8080/TCP 34m   This confirms that the NVIDIA Triton server metrics are being scraped by the Prometheus server. You can visualize these metrics using the Grafana dashboard.  In the Grafana dashboard below, you can see several important metrics:  Average GPU Power Usage: This gauge shows the current power usage of the GPU, which is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and performance of your inference tasks.Compute Time (milliseconds): This bar graph displays the time taken to compute inference requests, helping identify any latency issues.Cumulative Inference Requests: This graph shows the total number of inference requests processed over time, providing insights into the workload and performance trends.Queue Time (milliseconds): This line graph indicates the time requests spend in the queue before being processed, highlighting potential bottlenecks in the system.    To create a new Grafana dashboard to monitor these metrics, follow the steps below:  - Port-forward Grafana service: kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 8080:80 -n kube-prometheus-stack - Grafana Admin user admin - Get secret name from Terraform output terraform output grafana_secret_name - Get admin user password aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id &lt;grafana_secret_name_output&gt; --region $AWS_REGION --query &quot;SecretString&quot; --output text   Login to Grafana:  Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.Login with the username admin and the password retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager.  Import an Open Source Grafana Dashboard:  Once logged in, click on the &quot;+&quot; icon on the left sidebar and select &quot;Import&quot;.Enter the following URL to import the dashboard JSON: Triton Server Grafana DashboardFollow the prompts to complete the import process.

These differences enable vLLMs to excel in tasks like language translation, text generation, and conversational AI, whereas traditional models are better suited for tasks like image classification or regression. ========= TensorRT (Triton Runtime) optimizes LLM (Large Language Model) inference on NVIDIA hardware by: 1. **Model Pruning**: Removing unnecessary weights and connections to reduce model size and computational requirements. 2. **Quantization**: Converting floating-point models to lower-precision integer formats (e.g., INT8) to reduce memory bandwidth and improve performance. 3. **Kernel Fusion**: Combining multiple kernel launches into a single launch to reduce overhead and improve parallelism. 4. **Optimized Tensor Cores**: Utilizing NVIDIA's Tensor Cores for matrix multiplication, which provides significant performance boosts. 5. **Batching**: Processing multiple input batches concurrently to improve throughput. 6. **Mixed Precision**: Using a combination of floating-point and integer precision to balance accuracy and performance. 7. **Graph Optimization**: Reordering and reorganizing the computation graph to minimize memory access and optimize data transfer. By applying these optimizations, TensorRT can significantly accelerate LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware, achieving faster inference times and improved performance. =========   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Open WebUI Deployment​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NVIDIA NIM LLM Deployment on Amazon EKS","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/gen-ai/inference/GPUs/nvidia-nim-llama3#open-webui-deployment","content":" info Open WebUI is compatible only with models that work with the OpenAI API server and Ollama.  1.

However, by default, the Ray head Pod represents a single point of failure; if it fails, the entire cluster including the Ray worker Pods need to be restarted.  To address this, High Availability (HA) for the Ray head node is essential. Global Control Service (GCS) manages cluster-level metadata in a RayCluster. By default, the GCS lacks fault tolerance as it stores all data in-memory, and a failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To avoid this, one must add fault tolerance to Ray’s Global Control Store (GCS), which allows the Ray Serve application to serve traffic even when the head node crashes. In the event of a GCS restart, it retrieves all the data from the Redis instance and resumes its regular functions.      Following sections provide the steps on how to enable GCS fault tolerance and ensure high availability for the Ray head Pod.

You can choose to host your own Redis database, or you can use one through a third-party vendor.  For development and testing purposes, you can also host a containerized Redis database on the same EKS cluster as your Ray cluster. However, for production setups, it's recommended to use a highly available external Redis cluster. In this pattern, we've used Amazon ElasticCache for Redis to create an external Redis cluster. You can also choose to use Amazon memoryDB for setting up a Redis cluster.  As part of the current blueprint, we've added a terraform module named elasticache that creates an Elastic Cache Redis cluster in AWS. This uses The Redis cluster has cluster mode disabled and contain one node. This cluster node's endpoint can be used for both reads and writes.  Key things to note in this module are -  The Redis Cluster is in the same VPC as the EKS cluster. If the Redis cluster is created in a separate VPC, then VPC peering needs to be set up between the EKS cluster VPC and the Elastic Cache Redis cluster VPC to enable network connectivity.A cache subnet group needs to be created at the time of creating the Redis cluster. A subnet group is a collection of subnets that you may want to designate for your caches in a VPC. ElastiCache uses that cache subnet group to assign IP addresses within that subnet to each cache node in the cache. The blueprint automatically adds all the subnets used by the EKS cluster in the subnet group for the Elastic cache Redis cluster.Security Group - The Security Group assigned to the Redis cache needs to have an inbound rule that allows TCP traffic from EKS Cluster's worker node security group to the Redis cluster security group over port 6379. This is because the Ray head Pod needs to establish a connection to the Elastic cache Redis cluster over port 6379. The blueprint automatically sets up the security group with the inbound rule.  To create the Redis cluster using Amazon Elastic Cache, please follow the below steps.  info This Mistral7b deployment is using Ray Serve with High availability. If you have already deployed mistral7b in the previous steps, then you can delete the deployment and run the below steps.

In contrast, Trn1/Inf2 instances, such as trn1.32xlarge, trn1n.32xlarge, inf2.24xlarge and inf2.48xlarge, are purpose built for high-performance deep learning (DL) training and inference of generative AI models, including LLMs. They offer both scalability and availability, ensuring that you can deploy and scale your Stable-diffusion-xl models as needed, without resource bottlenecks or delays.  Cost Optimization:Running LLMs on traditional GPU instances can be cost-prohibitive, especially given the scarcity of GPUs and their competitive pricing.Trn1/Inf2 instances provide a cost-effective alternative. By offering dedicated hardware optimized for AI and machine learning tasks, Trn1/Inf2 instances allow you to achieve top-notch performance at a fraction of the cost. This cost optimization enables you to allocate your budget efficiently, making LLM deployment accessible and sustainable.  Performance BoostWhile Stable-Diffusion-xl can achieve high-performance inference on GPUs, Neuron accelerators take performance to the next level. Neuron accelerators are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, providing hardware acceleration that significantly enhances Stable-diffusion's inference speeds. This translates to faster response times and improved user experiences when deploying Stable-Diffusion-xl on Trn1/Inf2 instances.

Traditional GPU instances often face scarcity due to high demand, making it challenging to provision and scale resources effectively.  In contrast, Trn1/Inf2 instances, such as trn1.32xlarge, trn1n.32xlarge, inf2.24xlarge and inf2.48xlarge, are purpose built for high-performance deep learning (DL) training and inference of generative AI models, including LLMs. They offer both scalability and availability, ensuring that you can deploy and scale your Llama-3 models as needed, without resource bottlenecks or delays.  Cost Optimization  Running LLMs on traditional GPU instances can be cost-prohibitive, especially given the scarcity of GPUs and their competitive pricing. Trn1/Inf2 instances provide a cost-effective alternative. By offering dedicated hardware optimized for AI and machine learning tasks, Trn1/Inf2 instances allow you to achieve top-notch performance at a fraction of the cost. This cost optimization enables you to allocate your budget efficiently, making LLM deployment accessible and sustainable.  Performance Boost  While Llama-3 can achieve high-performance inference on GPUs, Neuron accelerators take performance to the next level. Neuron accelerators are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, providing hardware acceleration that significantly enhances Llama-3's inference speeds. This translates to faster response times and improved user experiences when deploying Llama-3 on Trn1/Inf2 instances.

The operator watches for user events related to these resources, automatically creates necessary Kubernetes artifacts to form Ray clusters, and continuously monitors cluster state to ensure the desired configuration matches the actual state. It handles lifecycle management including setup, dynamic scaling of worker groups, and teardown, abstracting away the complexity of managing Ray applications on Kubernetes.  Each Ray cluster consists of a head node pod and a collection of worker node pods, with optional autoscaling support to size clusters according to workload requirements. KubeRay supports heterogeneous compute nodes (including GPUs) and running multiple Ray clusters with different Ray versions in the same Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, KubeRay can integrate with AWS Inferentia accelerators, enabling efficient deployment of large language models like Llama 3 on specialized hardware, potentially improving performance and cost-effectiveness for machine learning inference tasks.  Having deployed the EKS cluster with all the necessary components, we can now proceed with the steps to deploy NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct using RayServe and vLLM on AWS Accelerators.  Step 1: To deploy the RayService cluster, navigate to the directory containing the vllm-rayserve-deployment.yaml file and execute the kubectl apply command in your terminal. This will apply the RayService configuration and deploy the cluster on your EKS setup.  cd data-on-eks/gen-ai/inference/vllm-rayserve-inf2 kubectl apply -f vllm-rayserve-deployment.yaml   Optional Configuration  By default, an inf2.8xlarge instance will be provisioned.

The Head Pod is expected to be ready within 5 to 6 minutes, while the Ray Serve worker pod may take up to 10 minutes for image retrieval and Model deployment from Huggingface.  According to the RayServe configuration, you will have one Ray head pod running on an x86 instance and one worker pod running on a inf2 instance. You can modify the RayServe YAML file to run multiple replicas; however, be aware that each additional replica can potentially create new instances.  kubectl get pods -n vllm   NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE lm-llama3-inf2-raycluster-ksh7w-worker-inf2-group-dcs5n 1/1 Running 0 2d4h vllm-llama3-inf2-raycluster-ksh7w-head-4ck8f 2/2 Running 0 2d4h   This deployment also configures a service with multiple ports.

Trn1.32xl Instance: This is an EC2 accelerated instance type that is part of the EC2 Trn1 (Trainium) instance family, optimized for machine learning training workloads  MPI Worker Pods: These are Kubernetes pods configured for running MPI (Message Passing Interface) tasks. MPI is a standard for distributed memory parallel computing. Each worker pod runs on a trn1.32xlarge instance which is equipped with 16 Trainium accelerators and 8 Elastic Fabric Adapters (EFAs). EFAs are network devices that support high-performance computing applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.  MPI Launcher Pod: This pod is responsible for coordinating the MPI job across the worker pods. When a training job is first submitted to the cluster, an MPI launcher pod is created which waits for the workers to come online, connects to each worker, and invokes the training script.  MPI Operator: An operator in Kubernetes is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. The MPI Operator automates the deployment and management of MPI workloads.  FSx for Lustre: A shared, high-performance filesystem which is well suited for workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. The FSx for Lustre filesystem will be shared across worker pods in the training job, providing a central repository to access the training data and to store model artifacts and logs.

The combination of RayTrain and KubeRay, especially when leveraged with AWS Trainium, provides a robust framework for handling these demands efficiently and effectively:  RayTrain:​  Simplified Distributed Training: RayTrain is a high-level library built on the Ray framework that abstracts the complexities of distributed training. It allows you to scale your Llama-2 training across multiple nodes with minimal code changes. Ray's actor-based architecture and task-based parallelism enable efficient execution of distributed workloads.Flexible Strategies: RayTrain supports various distributed training strategies such as data parallelism and model parallelism. Data parallelism splits the dataset across multiple nodes, while model parallelism splits the model itself. This flexibility allows you to optimize training based on the specific needs of your model and the architecture of your training environment.Fault Tolerance: RayTrain includes built-in fault tolerance mechanisms. If a node fails, Ray can reschedule the tasks on other available nodes, ensuring that the training job continues without interruption. This feature is crucial for maintaining robustness in large-scale distributed training environments.Ease of Use: RayTrain offers intuitive APIs that simplify the setup and execution of distributed training jobs. Integrations with popular machine learning libraries like Hugging Face Transformers make it easier to incorporate RayTrain into your existing workflows without extensive modifications.  KubeRay:​  Integration with Kubernetes: KubeRay leverages Kubernetes' native capabilities to deploy, manage, and scale Ray clusters. This integration allows you to use Kubernetes' robust orchestration features to handle Ray workloads effectively.Dynamic Scaling: KubeRay supports dynamic scaling of Ray clusters. Ray's built-in autoscaler can request additional actor replicas based on workload demands, while Kubernetes tools like Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler manage the creation of new nodes to meet these demands.Horizontal Scaling: Scale your Ray clusters horizontally by adding more worker nodes as the computational load increases. This allows efficient handling of large-scale distributed training and inference tasks.Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): KubeRay utilizes Kubernetes CRDs to define and manage Ray clusters and jobs. This provides a standardized way to handle Ray workloads within the Kubernetes ecosystem.Fault Tolerance: KubeRay takes advantage of Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities. If a Ray head node or worker node fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts the failed components, ensuring minimal downtime and continuous operation.Distributed Scheduling: Ray's actor-based model and distributed task scheduling, combined with Kubernetes' orchestration, ensure high availability and efficient task execution even in the event of node failures.Declarative Configuration: KubeRay allows you to define Ray clusters and jobs using declarative YAML configurations. This simplifies the deployment and management process, making it easier to set up and maintain Ray clusters.Integrated Logging and Monitoring: KubeRay integrates with Kubernetes' logging and monitoring tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana. This provides comprehensive insights into the performance and health of Ray clusters, facilitating easier debugging and optimization.Spot Instances: Use Kubernetes' support for spot instances to run Ray clusters cost-effectively. This allows you to take advantage of lower-cost compute resources while maintaining the ability to scale as needed.  AWS Trainium:​  Optimized for Deep Learning: AWS Trainium-based Trn1 instances are specifically designed for deep learning workloads. They offer high throughput and low latency, making them ideal for training large-scale models like Llama-2. Trainium chips provide significant performance improvements over traditional processors, accelerating training times.Neuron SDK: The AWS Neuron SDK is tailored to optimize your deep learning models for Trainium.

There are multiple environment variables that can be altered for the mount location, cache location, S3 bucket name, log file location, and the URL of the package installation and the location of the of the installed package. These variables can be left as default as only the S3 bucket name is required to run.  The DaemonSet Pods will copy the script onto the Node, alter the permissions to allow execution, and then finally run the script. The Pod installs util-linux in order to have access to nsenter, which allows the Pod to execute the script in the Node space which allows the S3 Bucket to be mounted on to the Node directly by the Pod.  danger The DaemonSet Pod requires the securityContext to be privileged as well as hostPID, hostIPC, and hostNetwork to be set to true. Review below why these are required to be configured for this solution and their security implications.  securityContext: privileged Purpose: privileged mode gives the container full access to all host resources, similar to root access on the host.To install software packages, configure the system, and mount the S3 bucket onto the host, your container will likely need elevated permissions. Without privileged mode, the container might not have sufficient permissions to perform these actions on the host filesystem and network interfaces. hostPID Purpose: nsenter allows you to enter various namespaces, including the PID namespace of the host.When using nsenter to enter the host’s PID namespace, the container needs access to the host’s PID namespace. Thus, enabling hostPID: true is necessary to interact with processes on the host, which is crucial for operations like installing packages or running commands that require host-level process visibility like mountpoint-s3. hostIPC Purpose: hostIPC enables your container to share the host’s inter-process communication namespace, which includes shared memory.If nsenter commands or the script to run involves shared memory or other IPC mechanisms on the host, hostIPC: true will be necessary. While it’s less common than hostPID, it’s often enabled alongside it when nsenter is involved, especially if the script needs to interact with host processes that rely on IPC. hostNetwork Purpose: hostNetwork allows the container to use the host’s network namespace, giving the container access to the host’s IP address and network interfaces.During the installation process, the script will likely need to download packages from the internet (e.g., from repositories hosting the mountpoint-s3 package). By enabling hostNetwork with hostNetwork: true, you ensure that the download processes have direct access to the host’s network interface, avoiding issues with network isolation.  warning This sample code uses the spark-team-a namespace to run the job and host the DaemonSet. This is primarily because the Terraform stack already sets up IRSA for this namespace and allows the service account to access any S3 bucket. When using in production make sure create your own separate namespace, service account, and IAM role that follows the policy of least-privilege permissions and follows IAM role best practice   To view the DaemonSet, Click to toggle content! apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: s3-mount-script namespace: spark-team-a data: monitor_s3_mount.sh: | #!/bin/bash set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status # ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LOG_FILE=&quot;/var/log/s3-mount.log&quot; S3_BUCKET_NAME=&quot;&lt;S3_BUCKET_NAME&gt;&quot; # Replace with your S3 Bucket Name before applying to EKS cluster MOUNT_POINT=&quot;/mnt/s3&quot; CACHE_DIR=&quot;/tmp&quot; MOUNT_S3_BIN=&quot;/usr/bin/mount-s3&quot; MOUNT_S3_URL=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm&quot; # Function to install mount-s3 install_mount_s3() { echo &quot;$(date): Installing mount-s3&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE yum update -y | tee -a $LOG_FILE yum install -y wget util-linux | tee -a $LOG_FILE wget $MOUNT_S3_URL -O /tmp/mount-s3.rpm | tee -a $LOG_FILE yum install -y /tmp/mount-s3.rpm | tee -a $LOG_FILE } # Function to mount S3 bucket mount_s3_bucket() { echo &quot;$(date): Mounting S3 bucket: $S3_BUCKET_NAME to $MOUNT_POINT&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE $MOUNT_S3_BIN --metadata-ttl indefinite --allow-other --cache $CACHE_DIR $S3_BUCKET_NAME $MOUNT_POINT | tee -a $LOG_FILE if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;$(date): Failed to mount S3 bucket: $S3_BUCKET_NAME&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE exit 1 fi } # Ensure the mount point directory exists ensure_mount_point() { if [ ! -d $MOUNT_POINT ]; then echo &quot;$(date): Creating mount point directory: $MOUNT_POINT&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE mkdir -p $MOUNT_POINT fi } # Install mount-s3 install_mount_s3 # Continuous monitoring and remounting loop while true; do echo &quot;$(date): Checking if S3 bucket is mounted&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE ensure_mount_point if mount | grep $MOUNT_POINT &gt; /dev/null; then echo &quot;$(date): S3 bucket is already mounted&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE if ! ls $MOUNT_POINT &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then echo &quot;$(date): Transport endpoint is not connected, remounting S3 bucket&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE fusermount -u $MOUNT_POINT || echo &quot;$(date): Failed to unmount S3 bucket&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE rm -rf $MOUNT_POINT || echo &quot;$(date): Failed to remove mount point directory&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE ensure_mount_point mount_s3_bucket fi else echo &quot;$(date): S3 bucket is not mounted, mounting now&quot; | tee -a $LOG_FILE mount_s3_bucket fi sleep 60 # Check every 60 seconds done --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: name: s3-mount-daemonset namespace: spark-team-a spec: selector: matchLabels: name: s3-mount-daemonset template: metadata: labels: name: s3-mount-daemonset spec: hostPID: true hostIPC: true hostNetwork: true volumes: - name: script configMap: name: s3-mount-script - name: host-root hostPath: path: / type: Directory restartPolicy: Always containers: - name: s3-mount image: amazonlinux:2 volumeMounts: - name: script mountPath: /config - name: host-root mountPath: /host mountPropagation: Bidirectional securityContext: privileged: true command: - /bin/bash - -c - | set -e echo &quot;Starting s3-mount&quot; yum install -y util-linux echo &quot;Copying script to /usr/bin&quot; cp /config/monitor_s3_mount.sh /host/usr/bin/monitor_s3_mount.sh chmod +x /host/usr/bin/monitor_s3_mount.sh echo &quot;Verifying the copied script&quot; ls -lha /host/usr/bin/monitor_s3_mount.sh echo &quot;Running the script in Host space&quot; nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid ./usr/bin/monitor_s3_mount.sh echo &quot;Done&quot;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Executing Spark Job​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Mountpoint-S3 for Spark Workloads","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/resources/mountpoint-s3-for-spark#executing-spark-job","content":" Here are the steps to test the scenario using Approach 2 with DaemonSet:  Deploy Spark Operator ResourcesPrepare the S3 Bucket cd ${DOEKS_HOME}/analytics/terraform/spark-k8s-operator/examples/mountpoint-s3-spark/chmod +x copy-jars-to-s3.sh./copy-jars-to-s3.sh Set-up Kubeconfig aws eks update-kubeconfig --name spark-operator-doeks Apply DaemonSet kubectl apply -f mountpoint-s3-daemonset.yaml Apply Spark Job sample kubectl apply -f mountpoint-s3-spark-job.yaml View Job Running There are a couple different resources of which we can view logs of as this SparkApplication CRD is running.

This allows dependency JAR files to be stored and managed externally from the container image, decoupling them from the Spark jobs. Additionally, storing JARs in S3 enables multiple Pods to consume them, leading to cost savings as S3 provides a cost-effective storage solution compared to larger container images. S3 also offers virtually unlimited storage, making it easy to scale and manage dependencies.  Mountpoint-S3 offers a versatile and powerful way to integrate S3 storage with EKS for data and AI/ML workloads. Whether you choose to deploy it at the Pod level using PVs and PVCs, or at the Node level using USERDATA or DaemonSets, each approach has its own set of advantages and trade-offs.
