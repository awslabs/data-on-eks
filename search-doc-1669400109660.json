It offers highly scalable, cost-effective storage, which provides sub-millisecond latencies, millions of IOPS, and throughput of hundreds of gigabytes per second. Its popular use cases include high-performance computing (HPC), financial modeling, video rendering, and machine learning. FSx for Lustre supports two types of deployments: For storage, EMR on EKS supports node ephemeral storage using hostPath where the storage is attached to individual nodes, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume per executor/driver pod using dynamic Persistent Volume Claims. However, some Spark users are looking for an HDFS-like shared file system to handle specific workloads like time-sensitive applications or streaming analytics.
